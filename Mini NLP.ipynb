      "['Bette Ford', 'Bette Ford (born Harriet Elizabeth Dingeldein; June 24, 1927) is an American retired actress and former model turned professional bullfighter. She was the first American woman to fight on foot in the Plaza México, the world\\'s largest bullfight arena.\\n\\nEarly modeling and acting career\\nBorn as Harriet Elizabeth Dingeldein in McKeesport, Pennsylvania in 1927, she and her brother were raised by relatives after being abandoned, first by their mother and then later, by their father. After graduating from high school in 1945, she began her career as a model and actress in New York, where her modeling credits included stints as the Jantzen Bathing Suit Girl, the Camay Bride, and the Parliament Cigarette Girl, and her acting credits included appearances as a regular on The Jackie Gleason Show and The Jimmy Durante Show.\\n\\nBullfighting career\\nWhile on a modeling photo shoot in Bogotá, Colombia, Ford was introduced to the renowned matador Luis Miguel Dominguín and watched him fight in the ring. Soon after, Ford left New York for Mexico to train as a bullfighter. In 1954, Warner Bros made a documentary short about her training, Beauty and the Bull.\\nHer historic debut at the Plaza México was followed by several years of fighting as a figura (bullfighting celebrity) in Mexico and the Philippines. The studio MGM, which had offered her an acting contract before she left New York to become a bullfighter, planned a full-length feature film based on her life story, and sent several writers, among them John Meston, the co-creator of Gunsmoke, to meet with Ford and discuss a screenplay. Ford married Meston shortly after they met and then retired as a bullfighter.\\n\\nPost-bullfighting acting career\\nFord has appeared in feature films including the Clint-Eastwood-directed Sudden Impact and Honkytonk Man, and television series including Cheers, L.A. Law, Melrose Place, and Felicity. Her voice can be heard in The Animatrix, the companion animated DVD of the film trilogy The Matrix, and numerous commercials.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nShortly after moving to New York, she married another actor, David Ford, whose surname she kept although the marriage ended after nine months. She later married John Meston (July 30, 1914 – March 24, 1979) an American radio and television writer best known for co-creating (with Norman Macdonnell), the long-running radio/TV series, Gunsmoke. Ford\\'s third and current husband is Scott Wolkoff (born May 27, 1947), some two decades her junior.\\n\\nSelected filmography\\nSee also\\nPatricia McCormick (1927-2013), American woman professional bullfighter\\nList of female bullfighters\\n\\nNotes\\nExternal links\\n\"La Estocada\" (interviewed by Fortunato Salazar in Guernica magazine, 2011); accessed December 29, 2016.\\n\"Bette Ford: Story of a Lady Bullfighter\" (Bette Ford interviewed by \"Gus O\\'Shaugn\" in the Village Voice, 1955); accessed April 27, 2016.\\nBette Ford as a contestant on YouTube on What\\'s My Line, 1957']\n"
