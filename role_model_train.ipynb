      "[(998, 'Berenice Abbott (July 17, 1898 – December 9, 1991), née Bernice Alice Abbott, was an American photographer best known for her portraits of between-the-wars 20th-century cultural figures, New York City photographs of architecture and urban design of the 1930s, and science interpretation in the 1940s–1960s.\\n\\nEarly years\\nAbbott was born in Springfield, Ohio, the youngest of four children. and brought up there by her divorced mother, née Lillian Alice Bunn (m. Charles E. Abbott in Chillicothe OH, 1886).\\nShe took college preparatory classes and graduated in 1917. She attended Ohio State University for two semesters, but left in early 1918 because her German professor was dismissed because he was a German teaching an English class. Abbot wanted to take a job in journalism, but later lost interest in it and followed the path of photography because of the interaction with Eugene O’Neill after that she became attached to photography . Abbott was also a well known photographer in Paris to the migrants. She became an assistant to Man Ray and Eugene Atget. She later than got a job at the WPA and photographed pictures of neighborhoods in New York City.\\n\\nTrip to Europe, photography, and poetry\\nHer university studies included theater and sculpture, spending two years studying sculpture in Paris and Berlin. She studied at the Académie de la Grande Chaumiere in Paris and the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin. During this time, she adopted the French spelling of her first name, \"Berenice,\" at the suggestion of Djuna Barnes. In addition to her work in the visual arts, Abbott published poetry in the experimental literary journal transition. Abbott first became involved with photography in 1923, when Man Ray hired her as a darkroom assistant at his portrait studio in Montparnasse. Later, she wrote: \"I took to photography like a duck to water. I never wanted to do anything else.\" Ray was impressed by her darkroom work and allowed her to use his studio to take her own photographs. In 1921 her first major works was in an exhibition in the Parisian gallery \"Le Sacre du Printemps\". In 1926, she exhibited her work in the gallery \"Au Sacre du Printemps\" and started her own studio on the rue du Bac. After a short time studying photography in Berlin, she returned to Paris in 1927 and started a second studio, on the rue Servandoni.\\nAbbott\\'s subjects were people in the artistic and literary worlds, including French nationals (Jean Cocteau), expatriates (James Joyce), and others just passing through the city. According to Sylvia Beach, \"To be \\'done\\' by Man Ray or Berenice Abbott meant you rated as somebody\". Abbott\\'s work was exhibited with that of Man Ray, André Kertész, and others in Paris, in the \"Salon de l\\'Escalier\" (more formally, the Premier Salon Indépendant de la Photographie), and on the staircase of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées. Her portraiture was unusual within exhibitions of modernist photography held in 1928–1929 in Brussels and Germany.\\nIn 1925, Man Ray introduced her to Eugène Atget\\'s photographs. She became interested in Atget\\'s work, and managed to persuade him to sit for a portrait in 1927. He died shortly thereafter. She acquired the prints and negatives remaining in Eugène Atget’s studio at his death in 1927. While the government acquired much of Atget\\'s archive — Atget had sold 2,621 negatives in 1920, and his friend and executor André Calmettes sold 2,000 more immediately after his death — Abbott was able to buy the remainder in June, 1928, and quickly started work on its promotion. An early tangible result was the 1930 book Atget, photographe de Paris, in which she is described as photo editor. Due to a lack of funding, Abbott sold a one-half interest in the collection to Julien Levy for $1,000. Abbott\\'s work on Atget\\'s behalf would continue until her sale of the archive to the Museum of Modern Art in 1968. In addition to her book The World of Atget (1964), she provided the photographs for A Vision of Paris (1963), published a portfolio, Twenty Photographs, and wrote essays. Her sustained efforts helped Atget gain international recognition. Abbott\\'s work is mostly known for her monochrome designs of New York City and it\\'s beautiful architecture. She has three notable pictures one would be the ‘Under the El at the Battery’. The other would be \"Night View\". Lastly \"Portrait Of James Joyce\". There are works of her work in the United States at the SFMOMA and the J. Paul Getty Museum.\\n\\nChanging New York\\nIn early 1929, Abbott visited New York City, ostensibly to find an American publisher for Atget\\'s photographs. After New York when she was doing portrait photography most of the time, she moved on to documentary photography. Upon seeing the city again, however, Abbott immediately saw its photographic potential. Accordingly, she went back to Paris, closed up her studio, and returned to New York in September. She was a central figure that created bridge with photographic hubs in New York City. Her first photographs of the city were taken with a hand-held Kurt-Bentzin camera, but soon she acquired a Century Universal camera which produced 8 x 10 inch negatives. Using this large format camera, Abbott photographed New York City with the diligence and attention to detail she had so admired in Eugène Atget. Atget died in 1927 and she bought all his work which contained over 5000 negatives and glass slides from him and brought it to New York in 1929. Her work has provided a historical chronicle of many now-destroyed buildings and neighborhoods of Manhattan. Her work appeared in an exhibition \"Changing New York\" at the Museum Of City in 1937.This was a book made to show the transformation of New York City. She focused more on the physical part of the transformation rather than the mental part of it, such as the change of neighborhoods and the replacement of skyscrapers to low rise buildings.\\nAbbott worked on her New York project independently for six years, unable to get financial support from organizations (such as the Museum of the City of New York), foundations (such as the Guggenheim Foundation), or individuals. She supported herself with commercial work and teaching at the New School of Social Research beginning in 1933. In 1935, however, Abbott was hired by the Federal Art Project (FAP) as a project supervisor for her \"Changing New York\" project. She continued to take the photographs of the city, but she had assistants to help her both in the field and in the office. This arrangement allowed Abbott to devote all her time to producing, printing, and exhibiting her photographs. By the time she resigned from the FAP in 1939, she had produced 305 photographs that were then deposited at the Museum of the City of New York. Abbott\\'s project was primarily a sociological study embedded within modernist aesthetic practices. She sought to create a broadly inclusive collection of photographs that together suggest a vital interaction between three aspects of urban life: the diverse people of the city; the places they live, work and play; and their daily activities. It was intended to empower people by making them realize that their environment was a consequence of their collective behavior (and vice versa). Moreover, she avoided the merely pretty in favor of what she described as \"fantastic\" contrasts between the old and the new, and chose her camera angles and lenses to create compositions that either stabilized a subject (if she approved of it), or destabilized it (if she scorned it).\\nAbbott\\'s ideas about New York were highly influenced by Lewis Mumford\\'s historical writings from the early 1930s, which divided American history into a series of technological eras. Abbott, like Mumford, was particularly critical of America\\'s \"paleotechnic era,\" which, as he described it, emerged at end of the American Civil War, a development called by other historians the Second Industrial Revolution. Like Mumford, Abbott was hopeful that, through urban planning efforts (aided by her photographs), Americans would be able to wrest control of their cities from paleotechnic forces, and bring about what Mumford described as a more humane and human-scaled, \"neotechnic era\". Abbott\\'s agreement with Mumford can be seen especially in the ways that she photographed buildings that had been constructed in the paleotechnic era—before the advent of urban planning. Most often, buildings from this era appear in Abbott\\'s photographs in compositions that made them look downright menacing.\\nIn 1935, Abbott moved into a Greenwich Village loft with the art critic Elizabeth McCausland, with whom she lived until McCausland\\'s death in 1965. McCausland was an ardent supporter of Abbott, writing several articles for the Springfield Daily Republican, as well as for Trend and New Masses (the latter under the pseudonym Elizabeth Noble). In addition, McCausland contributed the captions for the book of Abbott\\'s photographs entitled Changing New York which was published in 1939. In 1949, her photography book Greenwich Village Today and Yesterday was published by Harper & Brothers.\\nRalph Steiner wrote in PM that Abbott\\'s work was \"the greatest collection of photographs of New York City ever made.\"\\n\\nGallery\\nMedia related to Changing New York at Wikimedia Commons\\n\\nBeyond New York City\\nIn 1934 Henry-Russell Hitchcock asked Abbott to photograph two subjects: antebellum architecture and the architecture of H. H. Richardson.\\nTwo decades later, Abbott and McCausland traveled US 1 from Florida to Maine, and Abbott photographed the small towns and growing automobile-related architecture. The project resulted in more than 2,500 negatives. Shortly after, Abbott underwent a lung operation. She was told she should move from New York City due to air pollution. She bought a rundown home in Blanchard, Maine along the banks of the Piscataquis River for US$1,000. Later, she moved to nearby Monson, remaining in Maine until her death in 1991. Most of her work is shown in the United States she has a couple in Europe but mostly in the U.S.\\nAbbott\\'s work in Maine continued after that project and after her move to Maine. Her last book was A Portrait of Maine (1968). Abbott won lots of awards and achievements she won an award called ‘deutscher fotobuchpreis award a German photo book prize. She later than got the Ohio\\'s women hall of fame for her black and white photography of New York City. She has a famous quote saying \"Photography doesn\\'t teach you to express emotions; it teaches you how to see\".\\n\\nApproach to photography\\nAbbott was part of the straight photography movement, which stressed the importance of photographs being unmanipulated in both subject matter and developing processes. She also disliked the work of pictorialists who had gained much popularity during a substantial span of her own career and, therefore, left her work without support from this particular school of photographers. Most of Abbott\\'s work was influenced by her childhood, she had an unhappy childhood and a lonely childhood. This gave her the determination to follow her dreams it made her a stronger person.\\nThroughout her career, Abbott\\'s photography was very much a display of the rise in development of technology and society. Her works documented and praised the New York landscape. This was all guided by her belief that a modern-day invention such as the camera deserved to document the 20th century.\\n\\nScientific work\\nAbbott was not only a photographer, but also founded the corporation, \"House of Photography,\" from 1947–1959, to develop, promote and sell some of her inventions. She stayed with scientific pictures for twenty years and she did it till she died. She has a famous quote saying \"the world is made my science\". Her works were displayed the rise of development of technology when she created scientific photographs her scientific photos became a hit within two weeks of her releasing them. These included a distortion enlarging easel, which created unusual effects on images developed in a darkroom, and the telescopic lighting pole, known today by many studio photographers as an \"autopole,\" to which lights can be attached at any level. Owing to poor marketing, the House of Photography quickly lost money, and with the deaths of two designers, the company closed.\\nAbbott\\'s style of straight photography helped her make important contributions to scientific photography. From 1958 to 1960, she produced a series of photographs for a high-school physics textbook, developed by the Physical Science Study Committee project based at MIT to improve secondary school physics teaching. Her work included images of wave patterns in water and stroboscopic images of moving objects, such as Bouncing ball in diminishing arcs, which was featured on the cover of the textbook. She contributed to the understanding of physical laws and properties of solids and liquids though her studies of light and motion. Between 1958 and 1961 she made a series of photographs for Educational Services Inc. was circulated by them and the Smithsonian Institution as an exhibition titled Image of Physics. In 2012, some of her work from this era was displayed at the MIT Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nThe film Berenice Abbott: A View of the 20th Century, which showed 200 of her black and white photographs, suggests that she was a “proud proto-feminist”; someone who was ahead of her time in feminist theory. Before the film was completed she questioned, \"The world doesn\\'t like independent women, why, I don\\'t know, but I don\\'t care.\" She identified publicly as a lesbian.\\nShe lived with her partner, art critic Elizabeth McCausland, for 30 years.\\nAbbott\\'s life and work are the subject of the 2017 novel The Realist: A Novel of Berenice Abbott, by Sarah Coleman.\\n\\nWork\\nNotable photographs\\nUnder the El at the Battery, New York, 1936.\\nNightview, New York, 1932.\\nJames Joyce, Paris, 1929.\\nJay Street #115 New York, c. 1936.\\nAutomat, 977 Eighth Avenue, New York, February 10, 1936.\\nRadio Row, Cortland Street, Manhattan, c. 1936.\\nNight Scene, Manhattan, New York, 1935.\\nTriboro Barber School, New York, 1935.\\nThe Hands of Jean Cocteau, 1927.\\nWest Street Row III, New York, 1938.\\nFifth Avenue Coach Company, New York, c. 1932.\\nEdward Hopper in His Studio, 1948.\\nFifth Avenue Houses, Nos. 4,6,8, 1936.\\nFlatiron Building, Broadway and 23rd Street, 1938.\\nTrinity Church and Wall Street Towers, New York, 1934.\\nAndre Beauclair, c. 1927.\\nMan Ray, c. 1926.\\n\\nSolo exhibitions\\nWeyhe Gallery, New York, NY, November 1930\\nPhotographs by Berenice Abbott at Julien Levy Gallery, New York, NY, September 26 – October 15, 1932\\nNew York Photographs by Berenice Abbott at Museum of the City of New York, New York, NY, October 1934 – January 1935\\nNew York Photographs by Berenice Abbott at Museum of Fine Arts, Springfield, MA, March 1935\\nNew York Photographs by Berenice Abbott at Jerome Stavola Gallery, Hartford, CT, April 1935\\nNew York Photographs by Berenice Abbott at Fine Arts Guild, Cambridge, MA, April 10–15, 1935\\nChanging New York, Washington Circuit, Federal Art Project, traveling exhibition, 1936\\nChanging New York at Museum of the City of New York, New York, NY, October 20, 1937 – January 3, 1938\\nChanging New York at Teachers College Library, New York, NY, November 1937\\nSolo exhibition at Hudson D.

She realized that a disposable phone might assist travelers like herself. Altschul created a new company called Diceland Technologies to exploit these technologies to make the phone she planned.\\n\\nFirst disposable cell phone\\nIn November 1999 Altschul teamed up with Lee Volte. Volte had been the Senior Vice President of Research and Development at Tyco. Altschul and Volte obtained several patents for what would be the world\\'s first disposable mobile phone. Their intellectual property also included the trademark \"Phone-Card-Phone\". The new device was a phone that was of a size similar to an existing phone card. The credit card sized device was less than five millimetres thick, and was not made from plastic or metal, but from materials based on recycled paper. The phone incorporated a magnetic strip which meant that credit card companies could store identification which would allow the phone owner to make purchases. The phone was intended to sell at about twenty dollars, and the purchaser would be able to make phone calls totaling up to an hour. The phone was sold as disposable, but it could also be recycled; people who returned their used phones would receive a credit of two to three dollars. Frost & Sullivan, declared the Phone-Card-Phone to be the 2002 Product of the Year.\\nAltschul and her company, Diceland Technologies, envisioned prospective customers of the Phone-Card-Phone as people who were not impressed by the latest technology or women who just wanted to ensure that their sons and daughters would be able to make phone calls to them and their families. Altschul aimed the marketing at those people who would not be interested in a long-term mobile phone contract or tourists who may not usually need a phone but would need one whilst holidaying abroad for the short period of their vacation.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nAltschul\\'s Book Website: \\'Sorry, You Can\\'t Enter Heaven\\'\\nList of Altschul\\'s Other Patents\\nAltshul\\'s Entry in \\'A History of Inventing in New Jersey\\'\\nFrost & Sullivan Entry on Altschul'), (1001, \"Betsy Ancker-Johnson (born April 29, 1927) is an American plasma physicist.

She studied with John Cage, Terry Riley, Robert Ashley, and Larry Austin, among others. She studied at the University of Kentucky, UC Davis, New York University and Mills College.\\nAnderson is best known in her field for her swales, a musical form she invented based on collages and samples of newly composed music rather than existing music. She told a reporter for the New York Times in 1995 she named the form based on this definition of the word: \"A swale is a meadow or marsh where a lot of wild things go together.\"\\n\\nPersonal life\\nAnderson was born in Lexington, Kentucky, United States and grew up in Mt. Sterling, Kentucky. She married the computer book author Elliotte Rusty Harold on July 28, 1995, one year after they met at a potluck dinner held by the New York Macintosh Users Group. A 1995 New York Times feature story on Harold\\'s wedding called her both old-fashioned and conventional and observed, \"She giggles often, as lightly as wind chimes.

Initially trained in violin and sculpting, Anderson pursued a variety of performance art projects in New York during the 1970s, focusing particularly on language, technology, and visual imagery. She became more widely known outside the art world when her single \"O Superman\" reached number two on the UK pop charts in 1981. She also starred in and directed the 1986 concert film Home of the Brave.\\nAnderson is a pioneer in electronic music and has invented several devices that she has used in her recordings and performance art shows. In 1977, she created a tape-bow violin that uses recorded magnetic tape on the bow instead of horsehair and a magnetic tape head in the bridge. In the late 1990s, she developed a talking stick, a six-foot (1.8 m) long baton-like MIDI controller that can access and replicate sounds.\\nAnderson met Lou Reed in 1992, and was married to him from 2008 until his death in 2013.\\n\\nEarly life and education\\nAnderson was born in Glen Ellyn, Illinois, on June 5, 1947, the daughter of Mary Louise (née Rowland) and Arthur T. Anderson. She graduated from Glenbard West High School. She attended Mills College in California, and eventually graduated in 1969 from Barnard College with a B.A. magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa, studying art history. In 1972, she obtained an M.F.A. in sculpture from Columbia University. Her first performance-art piece—a symphony played on automobile horns—was performed in 1969. In 1970, she drew the underground comix Baloney Moccasins, which was published by George DiCaprio. In the early 1970s, she worked as an art instructor, as an art critic for magazines such as Artforum, and illustrated children\\'s books—the first of which was titled The Package, a mystery story in pictures alone.\\n\\nCareer\\n1970s\\nShe performed in New York during the 1970s. One of her most-cited performances, Duets on Ice, which she conducted in New York and other cities around the world, involved her playing the violin along with a recording while wearing ice skates with the blades frozen into a block of ice; the performance ended only when the ice had melted away. Two early pieces, \"New York Social Life\" and \"Time to Go\", are included in the 1977 compilation New Music for Electronic and Recorded Media, along with works by Pauline Oliveros and others. Two other pieces were included on Airwaves, a collection of audio pieces by various artists. She also recorded a lecture for Vision, a set of artist\\'s lectures released by Crown Point Press as a set of 6 LPs.\\nMany of Anderson\\'s earliest recordings remain unreleased, or were only issued in limited quantities, such as her first single, \"It\\'s Not the Bullet that Kills You (It\\'s the Hole)\". That song, along with \"New York Social Life\" and about a dozen others, were originally recorded for use in an art installation that consisted of a jukebox that played the different Anderson compositions, at the Holly Solomon Gallery in New York City. Among the musicians on these early recordings are Peter Gordon on saxophone, Scott Johnson on guitar, Ken Deifik on harmonica, and Joe Kos on drums. Photographs and descriptions of many of these early performances were included in Anderson\\'s retrospective book, Stories from the Nerve Bible.\\nDuring the late 1970s, Anderson made a number of additional recordings that were released either privately or included on compilations of avant-garde music, most notably releases by the Giorno Poetry Systems label run by New York poet John Giorno, an early intimate of Andy Warhol. Among the Giorno-released recordings was You\\'re the Guy I Want to Share My Money With, a double-album shared with Giorno and William Burroughs (the original release had one LP side for each artist, with the fourth side triple-grooved, one for each, so the listener would hear a different track, depending on the position of the needle). In 1978, she performed at The Nova Convention, a major conference involving many counter-culture figures and rising avant-garde musical stars, including William S. Burroughs, Philip Glass, Frank Zappa, Timothy Leary, Malcolm Goldstein, John Cage, and Allen Ginsberg. She also worked with comedian Andy Kaufman in the late 1970s.\\n\\n1980s\\nIn 1980 Anderson was awarded an honorary doctorate from the San Francisco Art Institute. In 1982 she was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Arts—Film.\\nAnderson became widely known outside the art world in 1981 with the single \"O Superman\", originally released in a limited quantity by B. George\\'s One Ten Records, which ultimately reached number two in the British charts. The sudden influx of orders from the UK (prompted partly by British station BBC Radio 1 playlisting the record) led to Anderson signing a seven-album deal with Warner Bros. Records, which re-released the single.\\n\"O Superman\" was part of a larger stage work titled United States and was included on the album Big Science. Prior to the release of Big Science, Anderson returned to Giorno Poetry Systems to record the album You\\'re the Guy I Want to Share My Money With; Anderson recorded one side of the 2-LP set, with William S. Burroughs and John Giorno recording a side each, and the fourth side featured a separate groove for each artist. This was followed by the back-to-back releases of her albums Mister Heartbreak and United States Live, the latter of which was a five-LP (and, later, 4-CD) recording of her 2-evening stage show at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. She also appeared in a television special produced by Nam June Paik broadcast on New Years Day 1984, entitled \"Good Morning, Mr. Orwell\".\\nShe next starred in and directed the 1986 concert film Home of the Brave and also composed the soundtracks for the Spalding Gray films Swimming to Cambodia and Monster in a Box. During this time she also contributed music to Robert Wilson\\'s \"Alcestis\" at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She also hosted the PBS series Alive from Off Center during 1987, after having produced the short film What You Mean We? for the series the year before. What You Mean We? introduced a new character played by Anderson: \"The Clone\", a digitally alerted masculine counterpart to Anderson who later \"co-hosted\" with her when she did her presenting stint on Alive from Off Center. Elements of The Clone were later incorporated into the titular \"puppet\" of her later work, Puppet Motel. In that year, she also appeared on Peter Gabriel\\'s album So, in the song \"This is the Picture (Excellent Birds)\".\\nRelease of Anderson\\'s first post-Home of the Brave album, 1989\\'s Strange Angels, was delayed for more than a year in order for Anderson to take singing lessons. This was due to the album being more musically inclined (in terms of singing) than her previous works. The single \"Babydoll\" was a moderate hit on the Modern Rock Charts in 1989.\\n\\n1990s\\nIn 1991, she was a member of the jury at the 41st Berlin International Film Festival. In the same year, Anderson appeared in The Human Face, a feature arts documentary directed by artist-filmmakers Nichola Bruce and Michael Coulson for BBC TV. Anderson was the presenter in this documentary on the history of the face in art and science. Her face was transformed using latex masks and digital special effects as she introduced ideas about the relationship between physiognomy and perception. Her varied career in the early 1990s included voice-acting in the animated film The Rugrats Movie. In 1994 she created a CD-ROM titled Puppet Motel, which was followed by Bright Red, co-produced by Brian Eno, and another spoken-word album, The Ugly One with the Jewels. This was then followed by an appearance on the 1997 charity single Perfect Day.\\nIn 1996, Anderson performed with Diego Frenkel (La Portuária) and Aterciopelados for the AIDS benefit album Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin produced by the Red Hot Organization.\\nAn interval of more than half a decade followed before her next album release. During this time, she wrote a supplemental article on the cultural character of New York City for the Encyclopædia Britannica and created a number of multimedia presentations, most notably one inspired by Moby-Dick (Songs and Stories from Moby Dick, 1999–2000). One of the central themes in Anderson\\'s work is exploring the effects of technology on human relationships and communication.\\n\\n2000s\\nLife on a String appeared in 2001, by which time she signed a new contract with another Warner Music label, Nonesuch Records. Life on a String was a mixture of new works (including one song recalling the death of her father) and works from the Moby Dick presentation. In 2001, she recorded the audiobook version of Don DeLillo\\'s novel The Body Artist. Anderson went on tour performing a selection of her best-known musical pieces in 2001. One of these performances was recorded in New York City a week after the September 11, 2001, attacks, and included a performance of \"O Superman\". This concert was released in early 2002 as the double CD Live in New York.\\nIn 2003, Anderson became NASA\\'s first artist-in-residence, which inspired her performance piece The End of the Moon. She mounted a succession of themed shows and composed a piece for Expo 2005 in Japan. In 2005, Anderson visited Russia\\'s space programme—the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre and mission control—with The Arts Catalyst and took part in The Arts Catalyst\\'s Space Soon event at the Roundhouse to reflect on her experiences. She was part of the team that created the opening ceremony for the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. Later that year, she collaborated with the choreographer Trisha Brown and filmmaker Agnieszka Wojtowicz-Vosloo on the acclaimed multimedia project O Zlozony/O Composite for the Paris Opera Ballet. The ballet premiered at the Opera Garnier in Paris in December 2004. Anderson has also collaborated with William S. Burroughs, Jean Dupuy, Arto Lindsay, Bill Laswell, Ian Ritchie, Peter Gabriel, Perry Hoberman, David Sylvian, Jean Michel Jarre, Brian Eno, Philip Glass, Nona Hendryx, Bobby McFerrin, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Dave Stewart, Peter Gordon, Adrian Belew, Hector Zazou, and Lou Reed.\\nFrom the late 1990s Anderson and Lou Reed collaborated on a number of recordings together. Anderson contributed to \"Call on Me\" from Reed\\'s collaborative project The Raven, on the tracks \"Rouge\" and \"Rock Minuet\" from Reed\\'s Ecstasy, and \"Hang on to Your Emotions\" from Reed\\'s Set the Twilight Reeling; Lou Reed contributes to the tracks \"In Our Sleep\" from Laurie Anderson\\'s Bright Red and \"One Beautiful Evening\" from Anderson\\'s Life on a String. They were married on April 12, 2008 in a private ceremony in Boulder, Colorado. Nonesuch Records, a book of drawings titled Night Life, and a brand new album released in 2010 called Homeland.\\n\\nIn 2005, her exhibition The Waters Reglitterized opened at the Sean Kelly Gallery in New York City. According to the press release by Sean Kelly, the work is a diary of dreams and their literal recreation as works of art. This work, created in the process of re-experiencing or re-working her dreams while awake, uses the language of dreams to investigate the dream itself. The resulting pieces include drawings, prints, and high-definition video. The installation ran until October 22, 2005. In 2006, she contributed a song to Plague Songs, a collection of songs related to the 10 Biblical plagues.\\nIn 2006 Anderson was awarded a Residency at the American Academy in Rome. She narrated Ric Burns\\' Andy Warhol: A Documentary Film, which was first televised in September 2006 as part of the PBS American Masters series. Anderson also performed in Came So Far for Beauty, the Leonard Cohen tribute event held in the Point Theatre, Dublin, Ireland, on October 4–5, 2006.\\nMaterial from Homeland was performed at small work-in-progress shows in New York throughout May 2007, most notably at the Highline Ballroom on May 17–18, supported by a 4-piece band with spontaneous lighting and video visuals mixed live throughout the performances by Willie Williams and Mark Coniglio, respectively. A European tour of the Homeland work in progress then took place, including performances on September 28 and 29, 2007, at the Olympia Theatre, Dublin; on October 17–19 at the Melbourne International Arts Festival; in Russia at the Moscow Dom Muzyky concert-hall on April 26, 2008. The work was performed across the Atlantic in Toronto, Canada, June 14, 2008, with husband Lou Reed, making the \"Lost Art of Conversation\" a duet with vocals and guitar, with his ambling style contrasting with Anderson\\'s tightly wound performance. Anderson\\'s Homeland Tour performed at several locations across the United States as well, such as at the Ferst Center for the Arts, Atlanta, Georgia; The Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, New York City; and Harris Theater for Music and Dance in Millennium Park, Chicago, Illinois, co-presented by the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago.\\n\\n2010s\\nIn February 2010, Laurie Anderson premiered a new theatrical work, entitled Delusion, at the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Games. This piece was commissioned by the Vancouver 2010 Cultural Olympiad and the Barbican Centre, London.\\nAnderson was honored with the Women\\'s Project Theater Woman of Achievement Award in March 2010.\\nIn May/June 2010, Anderson curated the Vivid Live festival in Sydney, Australia together with Lou Reed. Her new album Homeland was released on June 22.\\nShe performed \"Only an Expert\" on July 15, 2010 on the Late Show with David Letterman, and her song \"Gravity\\'s Angel\" was featured on the Fox TV show So You Think You Can Dance the same day.\\nShe appears as a guest musician on several tracks from experimental jazz musician Colin Stetson\\'s 2011 album New History Warfare Vol. 2: Judges.\\nAnderson developed a theatrical work, entitled \"Another Day in America\". The first public showings of this work-in-progress took place in Calgary, Alberta in January 2012 as part of Theatre Junction GRAND\\'s 2011–12 season and One Yellow Rabbit\\'s annual arts festival, the High Performance Rodeo.\\nAnderson was named the Inaugural Distinguished Artist-In-Residence at The Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center(EMPAC) at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York in May 2012.\\nAnderson received the Honorary Doctor of Arts from the Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture in 2013.\\nIn June/July 2013, Anderson performed \"The Language of the Future\" and guest curate at the River to River Festival in New York City.\\nIn November 2013 she was the featured Guest of Honor at the B3 Biennale of the Moving Image in Frankfurt, Germany\\n\\nInventions\\nAnderson has invented several experimental musical instruments that she has used in her recordings and performances.\\n\\nTape-bow violin\\nThe tape-bow violin is an instrument created by Laurie Anderson in 1977. It uses recorded magnetic tape in place of the traditional horsehair in the bow, and a magnetic tape head in the bridge. Anderson has updated and modified this device over the years.\\nShe can be seen using a later generation of this device in her film Home of the Brave during the \"Late Show\" segment in which she manipulates a sentence recorded by William S. Burroughs. This version of the violin discarded magnetic tape and instead used MIDI-based audio samples, triggered by contact with the bow.\\n\\nTalking stick\\nThe talking stick is a 6-foot-long baton-like MIDI controller. It was used in the Moby-Dick tour in 1999–2000. She described it in program notes as follows:\\n\\nThe Talking Stick is a new instrument that I designed in collaboration with a team from Interval Research and Bob Bielecki. It is a wireless instrument that can access and replicate any sound. It works on the principle of granular synthesis. This is the technique of breaking sound into tiny segments, called grains, and then playing them back in different ways. The computer rearranges the sound fragments into continuous strings or random clusters that are played back in overlapping sequences to create new textures. The grains are very short, a few hundredths of a second. Granular synthesis can sound smooth or choppy depending on the size of the grain and the rate at which they\\'re played. The grains are like film frames. If you slow them down enough, you begin to hear them separately.\\n\\nVoice filters\\nA recurring motif in Anderson\\'s work is the use of a voice filter which deepens her voice into a masculine register, a technique which Anderson has referred to as \"audio drag\". Anderson has long used the resulting character in her work as a \"voice of authority\" or conscience, although she later decided that the voice had lost much of its authority and instead began utilizing the voice to provide historical or sociopolitical commentary, as it is used on \"Another Day in America\", a piece from her 2010 album Homeland.\\nFor much of Anderson\\'s career, the voice was nameless or called the Voice of Authority, although more recently, it was dubbed Fenway Bergamot at Lou Reed\\'s suggestion. The cover of Homeland depicts Anderson in character as Bergamot, with streaks of black makeup to give her a moustache and thick, masculine eyebrows.\\nIn \"The Cultural Ambassador\", a piece on her album The Ugly One with the Jewels, Anderson explained some of her perspective on the character:\\n\\n(Anderson:) I was carrying a lot of electronics so I had to keep unpacking everything and plugging it in and demonstrating how it all worked, and I guess I did seem a little fishy—a lot of this stuff wakes up displaying LED program readouts that have names like Atom Smasher, and so it took a while to convince them that they weren\\'t some kind of portable espionage system. So I\\'ve done quite a few of these sort of impromptu new music concerts for small groups of detectives and customs agents and I\\'d have to keep setting all this stuff up and they\\'d listen for a while and they\\'d say: So uh, what\\'s this? And I\\'d pull out something like\\n(Bergamot:) this filter, and say, now this is what I like to think of as the voice of authority. And it would take me a while to tell them how I used it for songs that were, you know, about various forms of control, and they would say, now why would you want to talk like that? And I\\'d look around at the SWAT teams, and the undercover agents, and the dogs, and the radio in the corner, tuned to the Super Bowl coverage of the war. And I\\'d say, take a wild guess.\\n\\nDiscography\\nStudio albums\\nSpoken word album\\nThe Ugly One with the Jewels (1995)\\nHeart of a Dog (Soundtrack) (2015)\\n\\nLive albums\\nUnited States Live (boxed set) (1984) US No. 192\\nLive in New York (2002)\\n\\nCompilation albums\\nTalk Normal: The Laurie Anderson Anthology (2000)\\n\\nCollaborations\\nYou\\'re the Guy I Want to Share My Money With with William S.

An interview with Laurie Anderson, 2016 Video by Louisiana Channel'), (1004, 'Mary Anderson (February 19, 1866 – June 27, 1953) was an American real estate developer, rancher, viticulturist and inventor of the windshield wiper blade. In November 1903 Anderson was granted her first patent for an automatic car window cleaning device controlled from inside the car, called the windshield wiper.\\n\\nEarly life\\nMary Anderson was born in Greene County, Alabama, at the start of Reconstruction in 1866. In 1889 she moved with her widowed mother and sister to the booming town of Birmingham, Alabama. She built the Fairmont Apartments on Highland Avenue soon after settling in. By 1893, Mary Anderson had moved west to Fresno, California where until 1898 she operated a cattle ranch and vineyard.\\n\\nInvention of the windshield wiper\\nIn a visit to New York City in the winter of 1902, in a trolley car on a frosty day, she observed that the motorman drove with both panes of the double front window open because of difficulty keeping the windshield clear of falling sleet. When she returned to Alabama she hired a designer for a hand-operated device to keep a windshield clear and had a local company produce a working model. She applied for, and in 1903 was granted, a 17-year patent for a windshield wiper. Her device consisted of a lever inside the vehicle that controlled a rubber blade on the outside of the windshield. The lever could be operated to cause the spring-loaded arm to move back and forth across the windshield. A counterweight was used to ensure contact between the wiper and the window. Similar devices had been made earlier, but Anderson\\'s was the first to be effective.\\nIn 1905 Anderson tried to sell the rights to her invention through a noted Canadian firm, but they rejected her application saying \"we do not consider it to be of such commercial value as would warrant our undertaking its sale.\" After the patent expired in 1920 and the automobile manufacturing business grew exponentially, windshield wipers using Anderson\\'s basic design became standard equipment. In 1922, Cadillac became the first car manufacturer to adopt them as standard equipment.\\n\\nLater life\\nAnderson resided in Birmingham, where she continued to manage the Fairmont Apartments until her death at the age of 87. At the time of her death she was the oldest member of South Highland Presbyterian Church. She died at her summer home in Monteagle, Tennessee. Her funeral was conducted by Dr. Frank A Mathes at South Highland and she was buried at Elmwood Cemetery.\\n\\nIn popular culture\\nAnderson\\'s invention of the windshield wiper is mentioned in Season 17, Episode 19: \"Girls Just Want to Have Sums,\" of the cartoon The Simpsons, during a debate between Marge Simpson and her husband and son, Homer and Bart, about gender equality:\\n\\nMarge: \"Well, a woman also invented the windshield wiper!\"\\nHomer: \"Which goes great with another male invention, the car!\"\\n\\nAnderson\\'s windshield wiper invention is also briefly mentioned on the British panel/quiz show; QI (Quite Interesting); Season 10, Episode 16 - \"Just the Job\".\\n\"When was the windshield wiper invented?\" was the Weather Channel \"Question of the Day\" for July 6, 2016.\\nNPR\\'s Morning Edition produced a profile, including an interview with her great-great-niece into her legacy and societal context on July 25, 2017.\\n\\nLegacy\\nIn 2011 she was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nMary Anderson entry on About.com\\nFamous Women Inventors'), (1005, 'Suz Andreasen (born March 24, 1964) is an American Artist known for her writings, musical compositions and vocals, and museum collection jewelry designs.\\n\\nEarly life\\nShe was born in Iowa, the fourth generation in a family of inventors and scientists.

Anne was the second woman both to attempt and to perish in a transatlantic aircraft flight. Through her marriage to Prince Ludwig of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Freudenberg, Anne was a Princess of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Freudenberg and a member of the Princely House of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Freudenberg.\\n\\nFamily\\nAnne was born on 25 May 1864 in London, England, a daughter of John Savile, 4th Earl of Mexborough, and his second wife Agnes Louisa Elizabeth Raphael.\\n\\nMarriage\\nAnne married Prince Ludwig of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Freudenberg, eighth child and sixth son of Wilhelm, Prince of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Freudenberg, and his first wife, Countess Olga Clara of Schönburg-Forderglauchau, on 15 May 1897 in London. Following their marriage, Anne became a citizen of the German Empire. In addition to her \"personal charms,\" Anne brought a great fortune to the marriage. Anne\\'s husband Ludwig mysteriously disappeared within a year of their marriage in the Philippines during the Spanish–American War, where he was killed during fighting between Emilio Aguinaldo-led insurgents and the United States Army in the Battle of Caloocan of the Philippine–American War. She was notified of her husband Ludwig\\'s death through the United States Embassy in London. Anne regained her British nationality in 1918 following World War I.\\n\\nAnti-seasick bed\\nBefore the outbreak of World War I, Anne continued to regularly visit the United States. On one such occasion in January 1913, she arrived on the White Star liner SS Majestic to New York City from Southampton. Accompanied by her secretary, Hughes Massie, Anne brought with her an \"automatic balancing bed\" of her own invention which she had declared prevented sea sickness.\\n\\nAviation enthusiast\\nAnne began flying as a passenger aboard aircraft in 1914. She then befriended Captain Leslie Hamilton, a World War I flying ace nicknamed the \"Flying Gypsy.\" Anne was a passenger when Hamilton flew in the 1923 King\\'s Cup Race. During her participation as a passenger in aviation events, she usually flew under her maiden name, \"Lady Anne Savile\".\\nIn 1922, Anne rode as a passenger in her own aircraft in a cup race from Croydon to Edinburgh, Scotland. In 1925, she and Hamilton attempted a flight from London to Paris. Following their departure, their aircraft was not seen after it passed Folkestone and a search of the English Channel was begun. After an all-night search, the aircraft was found near Pontoise, a northwest suburb of Paris, where it had been forced down due to engine trouble. Throughout her 13 years of flight, Anne achieved several aviation records in her own right.\\n\\nTransatlantic flight and disappearance\\nIn 1927, Anne financed Captain Leslie Hamilton\\'s attempt to set an aviation record by being the first aviator to fly over the Atlantic Ocean from east to west from England to Canada. Against her relatives\\' protests, including those of her brother John Horace Savile, 5th Earl of Mexborough, she decided to join Hamilton\\'s expedition as a passenger because she had dreamed of becoming the first woman to \"fly the sea\". Anne, Captain Hamilton, and Colonel Frederick F. Minchin took off from the aerodrome at Upavon, Wiltshire at 7:32 a.m. on 31 August 1927 in a large Fokker F.VII monoplane powered by a 450 hp Bristol Jupiter engine known as the Saint Raphael bound for Ottawa. For the historic flight, Anne was dressed in royal purple to demonstrate what style of clothing she felt women should wear during a transatlantic flight. Her wardrobe consisted of purple leather knee-breeches, a matching jacket, a black crush hat, black silk stockings, and high-heeled fur-lined boots. Anne\\'s flying suit was similar to those she had worn in previous cup races. The Archbishop of Cardiff blessed the aircraft and its occupants, and following the blessing, Anne discarded her coat and boarded the aircraft.\\n\\nThe Saint Raphael headed west from the coast of Ireland and was last seen by the crew of the SS Josiah Macy. Wireless communications with all points along the coast of Labrador failed to find any trace of the Saint Raphael following its disappearance in flight. Further searches failed to yield signs of the aircraft and its crew, and by 5 September, the remaining hope was that fish-carrying steamers or whalers had rescued Anne, Hamilton, and Minchin after the Saint Raphael plunged into the ocean, as it was supposed. On 5 September, Anne\\'s brothers, Earl Mexborough and the Honorable George Savile, announced that they believed their sister had died at sea along with Captain Hamilton and Colonel Minchin. Despite no signs of the Saint Raphael or its crew, it is presumed that Anne, Hamilton, and Minchin perished on 31 August 1927 in the North Atlantic Ocean near Labrador and Newfoundland. Savile family friend Princess Blucher von Wahlstatt told the United Press that \"[Anne\\'s] brothers did their best to dissuade her from the unnecessary adventure, but she was bent on going and refused to be dissuaded.\"\\nAt the time of her death, Anne was the second woman to disappear in an attempted transoceanic flight in nearly two weeks; the first was Mildred Doran, who had been participating in the Dole Air Race from Oakland, California, to Hawaii.\\nIn 1928, the Ontario Surveyor General named a number of lakes in the northwest of the province to honour aviators who had perished during 1927, mainly in attempting oceanic flights. The main lake so named is St Raphael Lake (50.64°N 91.08°W\\ufeff / 50.64; -91.08) named for the Saint Raphael; similarly-named lakes in the same general vicinity include Hamilton Lake (50.89°N 90.38°W\\ufeff / 50.89; -90.38), Minchin Lake (50.78°N 90.53°W\\ufeff / 50.78; -90.53) and Wertheim Lake (50.66°N 90.62°W\\ufeff / 50.66; -90.62), which commemorates Anne.\\nAnne was presumed dead by a court order made in London on 6 February 1928; she died intestate and left an estate valued at £28,265 (gross) and net personal property of £20,371.\\nA large memorial plaque commemorating the fateful flight and dedicated to Anne, Captain Hamilton and Colonel Minchin hangs in St Raphael\\'s church, Kingston upon Thames.\\n\\nTitles and styles\\n25 May 1864 – 15 May 1897: Lady Anne Savile\\n15 May 1897 – 31 August 1927: Her Serene Highness Princess Anne of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Freudenberg\\n\\nAncestry\\n\\n\\n== References =='), (1007, 'Virginia Apgar (June 7, 1909 – August 7, 1974) was an American obstetrical anesthesiologist, best known as the inventor of the Apgar score, a way to quickly assess the health of a newborn child immediately after birth. She was a leader in the fields of anesthesiology and teratology, and introduced obstetrical considerations to the established field of neonatology.\\n\\nEarly life and education\\nThe youngest of three children, Apgar was born and raised in Westfield, New Jersey to a musical family, the daughter of Helen May (Clarke) and Charles Emory Apgar. Her father was an insurance executive, and also an amateur inventor and astronomer. Her older brother died early from tuberculosis, and her other brother had a chronic illness. She graduated from Westfield High School in 1925, knowing that she wanted to be a doctor.\\nApgar graduated from Mount Holyoke College in 1929, where she studied zoology with minors in physiology and chemistry. In 1933, she graduated fourth in her class from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons (P&S) and completed a residency in surgery at P&S in 1937.\\nShe was discouraged by Dr. Allen Whipple, the chairman of surgery at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, from continuing her career as a surgeon because he had seen many women attempt to be successful surgeons and ultimately fail. He instead encouraged her to practice anesthesiology because he felt that advancements in anesthesia were needed to further advance surgery and felt that she had the \"energy and ability\" to make a significant contribution. Deciding to continue her career in anesthesiology, she trained for six months under Dr. Ralph Waters at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he had established the first anesthesiology department in the United States. She then studied for a further six months under Dr. Ernest Rovenstine in New York at Bellevue Hospital. She received a certification as an anesthesiologist in 1937, and returned to P&S in 1938 as director of the newly formed division of anesthesia. She later received a masters degree in public health at Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, graduating in 1959.\\n\\nWork and research\\nAs the first woman to head a specialty division at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center (now NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital) and Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, Apgar faced many obstacles. In conjunction with Dr. Allen Whipple, she started P&S\\'s anesthesia division. Apgar was placed in charge of the division\\'s administrative duties and was also tasked with coordinating the staffing of the division and its work throughout the hospital. Throughout much of the 1940s, she was an administrator, teacher, recruiter, coordinator and practicing physician.\\n\\nIt was often difficult to find residents for the program, as anesthesiology had only recently been converted from a nursing specialty to a physician specialty. New anesthesiologists also faced scrutiny from other physicians, specifically surgeons, who were not used to having an anesthesia-specialized MD in the operating room. These difficulties led to issues in gaining funding and support for the division. With America\\'s entrance into World War II in 1941, many medical professionals enlisted in the military to help the war effort, which created a serious staffing problem for domestic hospitals, Apgar\\'s division included. \\nWhen the war ended in 1945, interest in anesthesiology was renewed in returning physicians, and the staffing problem for Apgar\\'s division was quickly resolved. The specialty\\'s growing popularity and Apgar\\'s development of its residency program prompted P&S to establish it as an official department in 1949. Due to her lack of research, Apgar was not made the head of the department as was expected and the job was given to her colleague, Dr. Emmanuel Papper. Apgar was given a faculty position at P&S.\\n\\nObstetrics\\nIn 1949, Apgar became the first woman to become a full professor at P&S, where she remained until 1959. During this time, she also did clinical and research work at the affiliated Sloane Hospital for Women, still a division of NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital. In 1953, she introduced the first test, called the Apgar score, to assess the health of newborn babies.\\nBetween the 1930s and the 1950s, the United States infant mortality rate decreased, but the number of infant deaths within the first 24 hours after birth remained constant. Apgar noticed this trend and began to investigate methods for decreasing the infant mortality rate specifically within the first 24 hours of the infant\\'s life. As an obstetric anesthesiologist, Apgar was able to document trends that could distinguish healthy infants from infants in trouble. \\nThis investigation led to a standardized scoring system used to assess a newborn\\'s health after birth, with the result referred to as the newborn\\'s \"Apgar score\". Each newborn is given a score of 0, 1, or 2 (a score of 2 meaning the newborn is in optimal condition, 0 being in distress) in each of the following categories: heart rate, respiration, color, muscle tone, and reflex irritability. Compiled scores for each newborn can range between 0 and 10, with 10 being the best possible condition for a newborn. The scores were to be given to a newborn one minute after birth, and additional scores could be given in five-minute increments to guide treatment if the newborn\\'s condition did not sufficiently improve. By the 1960s, many hospitals in the United States were using the Apgar score consistently. Entering into the 21st century the score continues to be used to provide an accepted and convenient method for reporting the status of the newborn infant immediately after birth .\\nIn 1959, Apgar left Columbia and earned a Master of Public Health degree from the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health. From 1959 until her death in 1974, Apgar worked for the March of Dimes Foundation, serving as vice president for Medical Affairs and directing its research program to prevent and treat birth defects.\\nAs gestational age is directly related to an infant’s Apgar score, Apgar was one of the first at the March of Dimes to bring attention to the problem of premature birth, now one of the March of Dimes\\' top priorities. During this time, she wrote and lectured extensively, authoring articles in popular magazines as well as research work. In 1967, Apgar became vice president and director of basic research at The National Foundation-March of Dimes.\\nDuring the rubella pandemic of 1964–65, Apgar became an advocate for universal vaccination to prevent mother-to-child transmission of rubella. Rubella can cause serious congenital disorders if a woman becomes infected while pregnant. Between 1964 and 1965, the United States had an estimated 12.5 million rubella cases, which led to 11,000 miscarriages or therapeutic abortions and 20,000 cases of congenital rubella syndrome. These led to 2,100 deaths in infancy, 12,000 cases of deafness, 3,580 cases of blindness due to cataracts and/or microphthalmia, and 1,800 cases of intellectual disability. In New York City alone, congenital rubella affected 1% of all babies born at that time.\\nApgar also promoted effective use of Rh testing, which can identify women who are at risk for transmission of maternal antibodies across the placenta where they may subsequently bind with and destroy fetal red blood cells, resulting in fetal hydrops or even miscarriage.\\nApgar traveled thousands of miles each year to speak to widely varied audiences about the importance of early detection of birth defects and the need for more research in this area. She proved an excellent ambassador for the National Foundation, and the annual income of that organization more than doubled during her tenure there. She also served the National Foundation as Director of Basic Medical Research (1967–1968) and Vice-President for Medical Affairs (1971–1974). Her concerns for the welfare of children and families were combined with her talent for teaching in the 1972 book Is My Baby All Right?, written with Joan Beck.\\nApgar was also a lecturer (1965–1971) and then clinical professor (1971–1974) of pediatrics at Cornell University School of Medicine, where she taught teratology (the study of birth defects). She was the first to hold a faculty position in this new area of pediatrics. In 1973, she was appointed a lecturer in medical genetics at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.\\nApgar published over sixty scientific articles and numerous shorter essays for newspapers and magazines during her career, along with her book, Is My Baby All Right? She received many awards, including honorary doctorates from the Woman\\'s Medical College of Pennsylvania (1964) and Mount Holyoke College (1965), the Elizabeth Blackwell Award from the American Medical Women\\'s Association (1966), the Distinguished Service Award from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (1966), the Alumni Gold Medal for Distinguished Achievement from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons (1973), and the Ralph M. Waters Award from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (1973). In 1973 she was also elected Woman of the Year in Science by the Ladies Home Journal.\\nApgar was equally at home speaking to teens as she was to the movers and shakers of society. She spoke at March of Dimes Youth Conferences about teen pregnancy and congenital disorders at a time when these topics were considered taboo.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nThroughout her career, Apgar maintained that \"women are liberated from the time they leave the womb\" and that being female had not imposed significant limitations on her medical career. She avoided women\\'s organizations and causes, for the most part. Though she sometimes privately expressed her frustration with gender inequalities (especially in the matter of salaries), she worked around these by consistently pushing into new fields where there was room to exercise her considerable energy and abilities.\\nApgar never married, and died of cirrhosis on August 7, 1974, at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She is buried at Fairview Cemetery in Westfield.\\nMusic was an integral part of family life, with frequent family music sessions. Apgar played the violin and her brother played piano and organ. She traveled with her violin, often playing in amateur chamber quartets wherever she happened to be. During the 1950s a friend introduced her to instrument-making, and together they made two violins, a viola, and a cello. She was an enthusiastic gardener, and enjoyed fly-fishing, golfing, and stamp collecting. In her fifties, Apgar started taking flying lessons, stating that her goal was to someday fly under New York\\'s George Washington Bridge.\\n\\nLegacy\\nApgar has continued to earn posthumous recognition for her contributions and achievements. In 1994, she was honored by the United States Postal Service with a 20¢ Great Americans series postage stamp. In November 1995 she was inducted into the National Women\\'s Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, New York. In 1999, she was designated a Women\\'s History Month Honoree by the National Women\\'s History Project. In 2018, Google celebrated Apgar\\'s 109th birthday with a Google Doodle.\\n\\nHonors and awards\\nHonorary doctorate, Women\\'s Medical College of Pennsylvania (1964)\\nHonorary doctorate, Mount Holyoke College (1965)\\nDistinguished Service Award from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (1966)\\nElizabeth Blackwell Award, from the American Women\\'s Medical Association (1966)\\nHonorary doctorate, New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry (1967)\\nAlumni Gold Medal for Distinguished Achievement, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons (1973)\\nRalph M.

Rosenberg then returned to Palestine and worked for the Electrical Corporation until the mid 1960s. Ruth Arnon attributes her own love for science to her relationship with her father.\\nRuth Rosenberg was born in Tel Aviv, June 1, 1933. Because her older siblings had already taught Ruth basic reading and arithmetic, she started school in the second grade. When she finished elementary school, her mother realized her potential and convinced Barukh Ben-Yehuda (1894-1990) to allow her to attend high school at the Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium. Along with many in the youth movement, Ruth wished to join the military. Being too young, she studied chemistry at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and joined the IDF special academic study program allowing her to study and spend summers doing military training. Arnon earned her master\\'s degree in 1955, and served for two years as an officer in the IDF. During her time in the military, she married Uriel Arnon, an engineer at the Technion in Haifa. Ruth and Uriel Arnon had two children: Michal (b. 1957) and Yoram (b. 1961)\\n\\nCareer as a Scientist\\nOverview\\nRuth Arnon joined the Weizmann Institute of Science in 1960. She has focused most of her life on the field of immunology. While at Weizmann, Arnon served as the Head of the Department of Chemical Immunology, as the Dean of the Faculty of Biology and as Vice President of the Institute.  In addition, Professor Arnon served as the Director of the Institute\\'s MacArthur Center for Molecular Biology of Tropical Diseases from 1958-94. Much of Arnon\\'s work has been in the development of vaccinations and cancer research. One of her largest contributions to science was working alongside Professor Michael Sela to develop a drug for multiple sclerosis called Copaxone.\\nRuth Arnon served as the Chairperson of the Sciences division of the Israel Academy of Sciences from 1995 to 2001. She later was elected as President of the Israel Academy. She is also a member of the EMBO, the European Molecular Biology Organization. Arnon served as Secretary-General of the International Union of Immunological Sciences, the President of the European Federation of Immunological Societies, and is also a member of the European Union Research Advisory Board.\\nProf. Arnon has been involved in the publishing of more than four hundred articles and books in biochemistry and immunology, and has been the recipient of many prestigious awards throughout her career, most of which are listed in the Awards and Honors section below.\\n\\nCopaxone\\nProf. Arnon and Prof. Sela developed a new drug application for the treatment of multiple sclerosis called Copolymer 1. Its chemical name is glatiramer acetate. It was submitted by the TEVA Pharmaceutical Company to the FDA for approval, under the name of Copaxone, on June 14, 1995. Since multiple sclerosis is an immunological disease, Cop 1 is an immunospecific drug, which is no surprise, as Arnon has focused the majority of her work in the field of immunology. It specifically aids neuroprotection and generation as well as prevents the demyelination of axons, a hallmark of diseases such as multiple sclerosis. In fact, studies by Arnon et al. have shown an increase in myelination as a result of Cop 1. In a 2004 article, Arnon and Aharoni state that glatiramer acetate is \"highly effective in the suppression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in various species.\"\\n\\nCurrent Research\\nProf. Arnon is currently performing research on a universal, recombinant influenza vaccination, as well as cancer vaccine research. In a 2009 paper, Arnon speaks of research using virus-like particles (VLP) to induce an immune response. These particles cannot replicate, but possess the specific antigen presenting proteins that immune cells use to identify viruses. Therefore, a vaccine could introduce VLPs to an individuals immune system and bring about the production of memory cells. Arnon and Ben-Yedidia hypothesize that these vaccines would be effective against H5N1, a pandemic virus more commonly known as bird flu. They have tested the various synthetic vaccinations on mice and observed a significant immune response. In addition, they have put human lymphocytes in mice and also observed an immune response. Their research formed the basis of the company BiondVax, who have taken the universal flu vaccine into human clinical trials.\\nIn 2017 Prof. Arnon was appointed co-chair of the UK-Israel Science Council, alongside Prof. Lord Robert Winston. She has been a founding member of the council since 2010.\\n\\nAwards and honors\\n1979 - Robert Koch Prize in Medical Sciences, Germany\\n1986 - Jimenez Diaz Award, Spain\\n1990 - Elected Member of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities\\n1991 - Hadassah Women of Distinction Award\\n1994 - Chevalier de l\\'Ordre de la Légion d\\'Honneur, France\\n1998 - Wolf Prize in Medicine for the development of Cop1, or Copaxone\\n1998 - Rothschild Prize in Life Sciences.\\n2001 - Israel Prize in medicine.\\n2010 - First female president of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nHomepage at the Weizmann Institute'), (1009, 'Barbara S.

This development was used extensively by NASA and the medical industry, and it earned Askins the title of National Inventor of the Year in 1978.\\n\\nEarly years, education and early career\\nBarbara Askins (née Scott) was born in Belfast, Tennessee, in 1939. Originally a teacher, she returned to school to pursue a science career after having had a son and daughter. Askins earned Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees from the University of Alabama in Huntsville.\\n\\nResearch career\\nAskins is a physical chemist who worked for NASA\\'s Marshall Space Flight Center and is best known for her pioneering invention of a process in which \"images on developed photographic emulsions can be significantly intensified by making the image silver radioactive and exposing a second emulsion to this radiation.\" The resulting print, known as an autoradiograph, reproduces the image with significant increases in density and contrast. Her groundbreaking method enhanced underexposed emulsions and increased the limits of photographic detection. In short, it made visible the invisible in photos that would otherwise have been useless. This was very useful for a number of applications, including the coaxing of data from underexposed space images—such as those peering deep into space as well as those highlighting the geology of other bodies in our solar system.\\nAskins\\' invention also led to significant advances in the field of medical technology. In particular, Askins\\' method prompted improvements in the development of X-ray images. Medical images that were 96 percent underexposed suddenly become readable; this meant that doctors could dramatically decrease the amount of X-ray radiation they gave to patients when running routine or emergency tests. Askins\\' process was also later used in the restoration of old photographs. Askins patented her invention in 1978 (U.S. patent No. 4,101,780), and NASA employed it extensively for its research and development work.\\n\\nAwards and professional memberships\\nIn 1978, the Association for Advancement of Inventions and Innovations named Askins the National Inventor of the Year.

She has published seventeen books of poetry, sixteen novels, ten books of non-fiction, eight collections of short fiction, eight children’s books, and one graphic novel, as well as a number of small press editions in poetry and fiction. Atwood and her writing have won numerous awards and honors including the Man Booker Prize, Arthur C. Clarke Award, Governor General\\'s Award, and the National Book Critics and PEN Center USA Lifetime Achievement Awards. Atwood is also the inventor and developer of the LongPen and associated technologies that facilitate the remote robotic writing of documents.\\nAs a novelist and poet, Atwood\\'s works encompass a variety of themes including the power of language, gender and identity, religion and myth, climate change, and \"power politics.\" Many of her poems are inspired by myths and fairy tales which interested her from a very early age. Among her contributions to Canadian literature, Atwood is a founder of the Griffin Poetry Prize and Writers\\' Trust of Canada.\\n\\nPersonal life and education\\nAtwood was born in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, as the second of three children of Carl Edmund Atwood, an entomologist and Margaret Dorothy (née Killam), a former dietitian and nutritionist from Woodville, Nova Scotia. Because of her father’s ongoing research in forest entomology, Atwood spent much of her childhood in the backwoods of northern Quebec and travelling back and forth between Ottawa, Sault Ste. Marie, and Toronto. She did not attend school full-time until she was eight years old. She became a voracious reader of literature, Dell pocketbook mysteries, Grimm\\'s Fairy Tales, Canadian animal stories and comic books. She attended Leaside High School in Leaside, Toronto, and graduated in 1957. Atwood began writing plays and poems at the age of six.\\nAtwood realized she wanted to write professionally when she was sixteen. In 1957, she began studying at Victoria College in the University of Toronto, where she published poems and articles in Acta Victoriana, the college literary journal, and participated in the sophomore theatrical tradition of The Bob Comedy Revue. Her professors included Jay Macpherson and Northrop Frye. She graduated in 1961 with a Bachelor of Arts in English (honours) and minors in philosophy and French.\\nIn 1961 Atwood began graduate studies at Radcliffe College of Harvard University, with a Woodrow Wilson fellowship. She obtained a master\\'s degree (MA) from Radcliffe in 1962 and pursued doctoral studies for two years, but did not finish her dissertation, \"The English Metaphysical Romance\".\\nIn 1968, Atwood married Jim Polk; they were divorced in 1973. She formed a relationship with fellow novelist Graeme Gibson soon afterward and moved to a farm near Alliston, Ontario, where their daughter, Eleanor Jess Atwood Gibson, was born in 1976. The family returned to Toronto in 1980.\\n\\nCareer\\n1960s\\nAtwood\\'s first book of poetry, Double Persephone, was published as a pamphlet by Hawskhead Press in 1961, winning the E.J. Pratt Medal. While continuing to write, Atwood was a lecturer in English at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver from 1964 to 1965, Instructor in English at the Sir George Williams University in Montreal from 1967 to 1968, and taught at the University of Alberta from 1969 to 1970. In 1966, The Circle Game was published, winning the Governor General\\'s Award. This collection was followed by three other small press collections of poetry: Kaleidoscopes Baroque: a poem, Cranbrook Academy of Art (1965); Talismans for Children, Cranbrook Academy of Art (1965); and Speeches for Doctor Frankenstein, Cranbrook Academy of Art (1966); as well as, The Animals in That Country (1968). Atwood\\'s first novel, The Edible Woman, was published in 1969. As a social satire of North American consumerism, many critics have often cited the novel as an early example of the feminist concerns found in many of Atwood\\'s works.\\n\\n1970s\\nAtwood taught at York University in Toronto from 1971 to 1972 and was a writer-in-residence at the University of Toronto during the 1972/1973 academic year. A prolific period for her poetry, Atwood published six collections over the course of the decade: The Journals of Susanna Moodie (1970), Procedures for Underground (1970), Power Politics (1971), You Are Happy (1974), Selected Poems 1965–1975 (1976), and Two-Headed Poems (1978). Atwood also published three novels during this time: Surfacing (1972); Lady Oracle (1976); and Life Before Man (1979), which was a finalist for the Governor General\\'s Award. Surfacing, Lady Oracle, and Life Before Man, like The Edible Woman, explore identity and social constructions of gender as they relate to topics such as nationhood and sexual politics. In particular, Surfacing, along with her first non-fiction monograph, Survival: A Thematic Guide to Canadian Literature (1972), helped establish Atwood as an important and emerging voice in Canadian literature. In 1977 Atwood published her first short story collection, Dancing Girls, which was the winner of the St. Lawrence Award for Fiction and the award of The Periodical Distributors of Canada for Short Fiction.\\nBy 1976 interest in Atwood, her works, and her life were high enough that Maclean\\'s declared her to be \"Canada\\'s most gossiped-about writer.\"\\n\\n1980s\\nAtwood\\'s literary reputation continued to rise in the 1980s with the publication of Bodily Harm (1981); The Handmaid\\'s Tale (1985), winner of the Arthur C. Clarke Award and 1985 Governor General\\'s Award and finalist for the 1986 Booker Prize; and Cat\\'s Eye (1988), finalist for both the 1988 Governor General\\'s Award and the 1989 Booker Prize. Despite her distaste for literary labels, Atwood has since conceded to referring to The Handmaid\\'s Tale as a work of science fiction or, more accurately, speculative fiction. As she has repeatedly noted, “There’s a precedent in real life for everything in the book. I decided not to put anything in that somebody somewhere hadn’t already done.\"\\nWhile reviewers and critics have been tempted to read autobiographical elements of Atwood\\'s life in her work, particularly Cat\\'s Eye,  in general Atwood resists the desire of critics to read too closely for an author\\'s life in their writing. Filmmaker Michael Rubbo\\'s Margaret Atwood: Once in August (1984) details the filmmaker\\'s frustration in uncovering autobiographical evidence and inspiration in Atwood\\'s works.\\nDuring the 1980s, Atwood continued to teach, serving as the M.F.A. Honorary Chair the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa,1985; the Berg Professor of English, New York University, 1986; Writer-In-Residence, Macquarie University, Australia, 1987; and Writer-In-Residence, Trinity University, San Antonio, Texas, 1989. Regarding her stints with teaching, she has noted, \"Success for me meant no longer having to teach at university.”\\n\\n1990s\\nAtwood\\'s reputation as a writer continued to grow with the publication of the novels The Robber Bride (1993), finalist for the 1994 Governor General\\'s Award and shortlisted for the James Tiptree, Jr. Award, and Alias Grace (1996), winner of the 1996 Giller Prize, finalist for the 1996 Booker Prize, finalist for the 1996 Governor General\\'s Award, and shortlisted for the 1997 Orange Prize for Fiction. Although vastly different in context and form, both novels use female characters to question good and evil and morality through their portrayal of female villains. As Atwood noted about The Robber Bride, \"I\\'m not making a case for evil behavior, but unless you have some women characters portrayed as evil characters, you\\'re not playing with a full range.\" The Robber Bride takes place in contemporary Toronto, while Alias Grace is a work of historical fiction detailing the 1843 murders of Thomas Kinnear and his housekeeper Nancy Montgomery. Atwood had previously written the 1974 CBC made-for-TV film The Servant Girl, about the life of Grace Marks, the young servant who, along with James McDermott, was convicted of the crime.\\n\\n2000s\\nNovels\\nIn 2000 Atwood published her tenth novel, The Blind Assassin, to critical acclaim, winning both the Booker Prize and the Hammett Prize in 2000. The Blind Assassin was also nominated for the Governor General\\'s Award in 2000, Orange Prize for Fiction, and the International Dublin Literary Award in 2002. In 2001, Atwood was inducted into Canada\\'s Walk of Fame. Atwood followed this success with the publication of Oryx and Crake in 2003, the first novel in a series that also includes The Year of The Flood (2009) and MaddAddam (2013), which would collectively come to be known as the MaddAddam Trilogy. The apocalyptic vision in the MaddAddam Trilogy engages themes of genetic modification, pharmaceutical and corporate control, and man-made disaster. As a work of speculative fiction, Atwood notes of the technology in Oryx and Crake, \"I think, for the first time in human history, we see where we might go. We can see far enough into the future to know that we can’t go on the way we’ve been going forever without inventing, possibly, a lot of new and different things.” She later cautions in the acknowledgements to MaddAddam, \"Although MaddAddam is a work of fiction, it does not include any technologies or bio-beings that do not already exist, are not under construction or are not possible in theory.\"\\nIn 2005 Atwood published the novella The Penelopiad as part of the Canongate Myth Series. The story is a re-telling of The Odyssey from the perspective of Penelope and a chorus of the twelve maids murdered at the end of the original tale. The Penelopiad was made into a theatrical production in 2007.\\nIn 2016 Atwood published the novel Hag-Seed, a modern-day re-telling of Shakespeare\\'s The Tempest, as part of Penguin Random House\\'s Hogarth Shakespeare Series.\\n\\nNon-fiction\\nIn 2008 Atwood published Payback: Debt and the Shadow Side of Wealth, a collection of five lectures delivered as part of the Massey Lectures from October 12 to November 1, 2008.The book was released in anticipation of the lectures, which were also recorded and broadcast on CBC Radio One\\'s Ideas.\\n\\nChamber opera\\nIn March 2008, Atwood accepted her first chamber opera commission. Commissioned by City Opera of Vancouver, Pauline is set in Vancouver in March 1913 during the final days of the life of Canadian writer and performer Pauline Johnson.Pauline, composed by Tobin Stokes with libretto by Atwood, premiered on May 23, 2014 at Vancouver\\'s York Theatre.\\n\\nGraphic Fiction\\nIn 2016 Atwood began writing the superhero comic book series Angel Catbird, with co-creator and illustrator Johnnie Christmas. The series protagonist, scientist Strig Feleedus, is victim of an accidental mutation that leaves him with the body parts and powers of both a cat and a bird. As with her other works, Atwood notes of the series, \"The kind of speculative fiction about the future that I write is always based on things that are in process right now. So it\\'s not that I imagine them, it\\'s that I notice that people are working on them and I take it a few steps further down the road. So it doesn\\'t come out of nowhere, it comes out of real life.\"\\n\\nFuture Library Project\\nWith her novel Scribbler Moon, Atwood is the first contributor to the Future Library project. The work, completed in 2015, was ceremoniously handed over to the project on 27 May of the same year. The book will be held by the project until its eventual publishing in 2114. She thinks that readers will probably need a paleo-anthropologist to translate some parts of her story. In an interview with the Guardian newspaper, Atwood said, “There’s something magical about it,” says Atwood. “It’s like Sleeping Beauty. The texts are going to slumber for 100 years and then they’ll wake up, come to life again. It’s a fairytale length of time. She slept for 100 years.”\\n\\nInvention of the LongPen\\nIn early 2004, while on the paperback tour in Denver for her novel Oryx and Crake, Atwood conceived the concept of a remote robotic writing technology, what would later be known as the LongPen, that would enable a person to remotely write in ink anywhere in the world via tablet PC and the Internet, thus allowing her to conduct her book tours without being physically present. She quickly founded a company, Unotchit Inc., to develop, produce and distribute this technology. By 2011, Unotchit Inc. shifted its market focus into business and legal transactions and was producing a range of products, for a variety of remote writing applications, based on the LongPen technologies and renamed itself to Syngrafii Inc. As of September 2014, Atwood is still Co-founder and a Director of Syngrafii Inc. and holder of various patents related to the LongPen technology.\\n\\nRecurring themes and cultural contexts\\nTheory of Canadian identity\\nAtwood’s contributions to the theorizing of Canadian identity have garnered attention both in Canada and internationally. Her principal work of literary criticism, Survival: A Thematic Guide to Canadian Literature, is considered somewhat outdated, but remains a standard introduction to Canadian literature in Canadian Studies programs internationally. The continued reprinting of Survival by Anansi Press has been criticized as a view-narrowing disservice to students of Canadian Literature by some critics, including Professor Joseph Pivato.\\nIn Survival, Atwood postulates that Canadian literature, and by extension Canadian identity, is characterized by the symbol of survival. This symbol is expressed in the omnipresent use of “victim positions” in Canadian literature. These positions represent a scale of self-consciousness and self-actualization for the victim in the “victor/victim” relationship. The \"victor\" in these scenarios may be other humans, nature, the wilderness or other external and internal factors which oppress the victim. Atwood’s Survival bears the influence of Northrop Frye’s theory of garrison mentality; Atwood uses Frye’s concept of Canada\\'s desire to wall itself off from outside influence as a critical tool to analyze Canadian literature. According to her theories in works such as Survival and her exploration of similar themes in her fiction, Atwood considers Canadian literature as the expression of Canadian identity. According to this literature, Canadian identity has been defined by a fear of nature, by settler history, and by unquestioned adherence to the community.\\nAtwood\\'s contribution to the theorizing of Canada is not limited to her non-fiction works. Several of her works, including The Journals of Susanna Moodie, Alias Grace, The Blind Assassin and Surfacing, are examples of what postmodern literary theorist Linda Hutcheon calls “Historiographic metafiction”. In such works, Atwood explicitly explores the relation of history and narrative and the processes of creating history.\\nAtwood continued her exploration of the implications of Canadian literary themes for Canadian identity in lectures such as Strange Things: The Malevolent North in Canadian Literature (1995).\\nAmong her contributions to Canadian literature, Atwood is a founding trustee of the Griffin Poetry Prize, as well as a founder of the Writers\\' Trust of Canada, a non-profit literary organization that seeks to encourage Canada\\'s writing community.\\n\\nFeminism\\nAtwood\\'s work has been of interest to feminist literary critics, despite Atwood\\'s unwillingness at times to apply the feminist label to her works. Starting with the publication of her first novel, The Edible Woman, Atwood asserted, \"I don’t consider it feminism; I just consider it social realism.\" Despite her rejection of the label at times, critics have analyzed the sexual politics, use of myth and fairytale, and gendered relationships in her work through the lens of feminism. She later clarified her discomfort with the label feminism by stating, \"I always want to know what people mean by that word [feminism]. Some people mean it quite negatively, other people mean it very positively, some people mean it in a broad sense, other people mean it in a more specific sense. Therefore, in order to answer the question, you have to ask the person what they mean.\"\\nIn January 2018 Atwood penned the op-ed \"Am I A Bad Feminist?\" for The Globe and Mail. The piece was in response to social media backlash related to Atwood\\'s signature on a 2016 petition calling for an independent investigation into the firing of Steven Galloway, a former University of British Columbia professor accused of sexual harassment and assault by a student. While feminist critics denounced Atwood for her support of Galloway, Atwood asserts that her signature was in support of due process in the legal system. She has been criticized for her comments surrounding the #MeToo movement, particularly that it is a \"symptom of a broken legal system.\"\\n\\nSpeculative and Science Fiction\\nAtwood has resisted the suggestion that The Handmaid\\'s Tale and Oryx and Crake are science fiction, suggesting to The Guardian in 2003 that they are speculative fiction instead: \"Science fiction has monsters and spaceships; speculative fiction could really happen.\" She told the Book of the Month Club: \"Oryx and Crake is a speculative fiction, not a science fiction proper. It contains no intergalactic space travel, no teleportation, no Martians.\" On BBC Breakfast, she explained that science fiction, as opposed to what she herself wrote, was \"talking squids in outer space.\" The latter phrase particularly rankled advocates of science fiction and frequently recurs when her writing is discussed.\\nIn 2005, Atwood said that she does at times write social science fiction and that The Handmaid\\'s Tale and Oryx and Crake can be designated as such. She clarified her meaning on the difference between speculative and science fiction, admitting that others use the terms interchangeably: \"For me, the science fiction label belongs on books with things in them that we can\\'t yet do... speculative fiction means a work that employs the means already to hand and that takes place on Planet Earth.\" She said that science fiction narratives give a writer the ability to explore themes in ways that realistic fiction cannot.\\n\\nEcocriticism\\nMargaret Atwood repeatedly makes observations about the relationship of humans to animals in her works. A large portion of the dystopia Atwood creates in Oryx and Crake rests upon the genetic modification and alteration of animals and humans, resulting in hybrids such as pigoons, rakunks, wolvogs, and Crakers, which function to raise questions on the limits and ethics of science and technology, as well as questions on what it means to be human.\\nIn Surfacing, one character remarks about eating animals: \"The animals die that we may live, they are substitute people...And we eat them, out of cans or otherwise; we are eaters of death, dead Christ-flesh resurrecting inside us, granting us life.\" Some characters in her books link sexual oppression to meat-eating and consequently give up meat-eating. In The Edible Woman, Atwood\\'s character Marian identifies with hunted animals and cries after hearing her fiancé\\'s experience of hunting and eviscerating a rabbit. Marian stops eating meat but then later returns to it.\\nIn Cat\\'s Eye, the narrator recognizes the similarity between a turkey and a baby. She looks at \"the turkey, which resembles a trussed, headless baby. It has thrown off its disguise as a meal and has revealed itself to me for what it is, a large dead bird.\" In Atwood\\'s Surfacing, a dead heron represents purposeless killing and prompts thoughts about other senseless deaths.\\n\\nPolitical involvement\\nAtwood has indicated in interviews that she considers herself a Red Tory in the historical sense of the term. In the 2008 federal election, she attended a rally for the Bloc Québécois, a Quebec separatist party, because of her support for their position on the arts, and stated that she would vote for the party if she lived in a riding in Quebec in which the choice was between the Bloc and the Conservatives. In a Globe and Mail editorial, she urged Canadians to vote for any other party to stop a Conservative majority.\\nAtwood has strong views on environmental issues, and she and Graeme Gibson are the joint honorary presidents of the Rare Bird Club within BirdLife International. Atwood celebrated her 70th birthday at a gala dinner at Laurentian University in Sudbury, Ontario. She stated that she had chosen to attend the event because the city has been home to one of Canada\\'s most ambitious environmental reclamation programs: \"When people ask if there\\'s hope (for the environment), I say, if Sudbury can do it, so can you. Having been a symbol of desolation, it\\'s become a symbol of hope.\" Atwood has been chair of the Writers\\' Union of Canada and helped to found the Canadian English-Speaking chapter of PEN International, a group originally started to free politically imprisoned writers. She held the position of PEN Canada president in the mid 1980s and was the 2017 recipient of the PEN Center USA’s Lifetime Achievement Award. Despite calls for a boycott by Gazan students, Atwood visited Israel and accepted the $1,000,000 Dan David Prize along with Indian author Amitav Ghosh at Tel Aviv University in May 2010. Atwood commented that \"we don\\'t do cultural boycotts.\"\\n\\nIn her dystopian novel, The Handmaid\\'s Tale, all the developments take place in the United States near Boston, while Canada is portrayed as the only hope for an escape. To some this reflects her status of being \"in the vanguard of Canadian anti-Americanism of the 1960s and 1970s.\" Critics have seen Gilead (the US) as a repressive regime and the mistreated Handmaid as Canada. During the debate in 1987 over a free trade agreement between Canada and the United States, Atwood spoke out against the deal and wrote an essay opposing the agreement. Atwood claims that the 2016 US presidential election led to an increase in sales of The Handmaid\\'s Tale. Inspired by The Handmaid\\'s Tale, the political action group The Handmaid\\'s Coalition was formed in 2017 in response to legislation and actions aimed at limiting the rights of women and marginalized groups. Activists, dressed in red cloaks and white hats as described in The Handmaid\\'s Tale, lobby and protest in order to bring awareness to politicians and laws that discriminate against women and women\\'s rights.\\n\\nAdaptations\\nThe novel Surfacing (1972) was adapted into an eponymous 1981 film, written by Bernard Gordon and directed by Claude Jutra. The film received poor reviews and suffers from making \"little attempt to find cinematic equivalents for the admittedly difficult subjective and poetic dimensions of the novel.\"\\nThe novel The Handmaid\\'s Tale (1985) has been adapted into several eponymous works. A 1990 film, directed by Volker Schlöndorff, with a screenplay by Harold Pinter, received mixed reviews. A musical adaptation resulted in the 2000 opera, written by Poul Ruders, with a libretto by Paul Bentley. It premiered at the Royal Danish Opera in 2000, and was staged in 2003 at London\\'s English National Opera and the Minnesota Opera. A television series by Bruce Miller began airing on the streaming service Hulu in 2017. The first season of the show earned eight Emmy\\'s in 2017, including Outstanding Drama Series. Season two premiered on April 25, 2018, and it was announced on May 2, 2018 that Hulu had renewed the series for a third season. Atwood appears in a cameo in the first episode as one of the Aunts at the Red Center.\\nAtwood\\'s 2008 Massey Lectures were adapted into the documentary Payback (2012), by director Jennifer Baichwal. Commentary by Atwood and others such as economist Raj Patel, ecologist William Reese, and religious scholar Karen Armstrong, are woven into various stories that explore the concepts of debt and payback, including an Armenian blood feud, agricultural working conditions, and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.\\nThe novel Alias Grace (1996) was adapted into an eponymous six-part 2017 miniseries directed by Mary Harron and adapted by Sarah Polley. It premiered on CBC on September 25, 2017, and the full series was released on Netflix on November 3, 2017. Atwood makes a cameo in the fourth episode of the series as a disapproving church-goer.\\nIn the Wake of the Flood (released in October 2010), a documentary film by Canadian director Ron Mann, followed Atwood on the unusual book tour for her novel The Year of the Flood (2009). During this innovative book tour, Atwood created a theatrical version of her novel, with performers borrowed from the local areas she was visiting. The documentary is described as \"a fly-on-the-wall film vérité.\"\\nAtwood\\'s children\\'s book Wandering Wenda and Widow Wallop’s Wunderground Washery (2011) was adapted into the children\\'s television series The Wide World of Wandering Wenda, broadcast on CBC beginning in the spring of 2017. Aimed at early readers, the animated series follows Wenda and her friends as they navigate different adventures using words, sounds, and language.\\nDirector Darren Aronofsky had been slated to direct an adaption of the MaddAddam trilogy for HBO, but it was revealed in October 2016 that HBO had dropped the plan from its schedule. In January 2018, it was announced that Paramount Television and Anonymous Content had bought the rights to the trilogy and would be moving forward without Aronofsky.\\n\\nAwards and honours\\nAtwood holds numerous honorary degrees (e.g., from Oxford University, Cambridge University, and the Sorbonne), and has won more than 55 awards in Canada and internationally.\\n\\nWorks\\nReferences\\nFurther reading\\nBauch, Marc (2012).

Known in adult life as Hertha Ayrton, born Phoebe Sarah Marks, she was awarded the Hughes Medal by the Royal Society for her work on electric arcs and ripples in sand and water.\\n\\nEarly life and education\\nHertha Ayrton was born Phoebe Sarah Marks in Portsea, Hampshire, England, on 28 April 1854. She was the third child of a Polish Jewish watchmaker named Levi Marks, an immigrant from Tsarist Poland; and Alice Theresa Moss, a seamstress, the daughter of Joseph Moss, a glass merchant of Portsea. Her father died in 1861, leaving Sarah\\'s mother with seven children and an eighth expected. Sarah then took up some of the responsibility for caring for the younger children.\\nAt the age of nine, Sarah was invited by her aunts, who ran a school in northwest London, to live with her cousins and be educated with them. She was known to her peers and teachers as a fiery, occasionally crude personality. Her cousins introduced Ayrton to science and mathematics. By age 16, she was working as a governess.\\nAs a teenager, Ayrton became deeply involved in the women\\'s suffrage movement, through which she met suffragist and co-founder of Cambridge\\'s Girton College, Barbara Bodichon. Bodichon helped make it financially possible to attend Girton, and would go on to financially support Ayrton throughout her education and career including by bequeathing her estate to Ayrton.\\nAt Girton, Ayrton studied mathematics and was coached by physicist Richard Glazebrook. George Eliot supported Ayrton\\'s application to Girton College. During her time at Cambridge, Ayrton constructed a sphygmomanometer (blood pressure meter), led the choral society, founded the Girton fire brigade, and, together with Charlotte Scott, formed a mathematical club. In 1880, Ayrton passed the Mathematical Tripos, but Cambridge did not grant her an academic degree because, at the time, Cambridge gave only certificates and not full degrees to women. Ayrton passed an external examination at the University of London, which awarded her a Bachelor of Science degree in 1881.\\n\\nMathematics and electrical engineering work\\nUpon her return to London, Ayrton earned money by teaching and embroidery, ran a club for working girls, and cared for her invalid sister. She also put her mathematical skills to practical use – she taught at Notting Hill and Ealing High School, and was also active in devising and solving mathematical problems, many of which were published in \"Mathematical Questions and Their Solutions\" from the Educational Times. In 1884 Ayrton patented a line-divider, an engineering drawing instrument for dividing a line into any number of equal parts and for enlarging and reducing figures. The line-divider was her first major invention and, while its primary use was likely for artists for enlarging and diminishing, it was also useful to architects and engineers. Ayrton\\'s patent application was financially supported by Louisa Goldsmid and feminist Barbara Bodichon, who together advanced her enough money to take out patents; the invention was shown at the Exhibition of Women\\'s Industries and received much press attention. Ayrton\\'s 1884 patent was the first of many – from 1884 until her death, Hertha registered 26 patents: five on mathematical dividers, 13 on arc lamps and electrodes, the rest on the propulsion of air.\\nIn 1884 Ayrton began attending evening classes on electricity at Finsbury Technical College, delivered by Professor William Edward Ayrton, a pioneer in electrical engineering and physics education and a fellow of the Royal Society. On 6 May 1885 she married her former teacher, and thereafter assisted him with experiments in physics and electricity. She also began her own investigation into the characteristics of the electric arc.\\nIn the late nineteenth century, electric arc lighting was in wide use for public lighting. The tendency of electric arcs to flicker and hiss was a major problem. In 1895, Hertha Ayrton wrote a series of articles for the Electrician, explaining that these phenomena were the result of oxygen coming into contact with the carbon rods used to create the arc. In 1899, she was the first woman ever to read her own paper before the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE). Her paper was entitled \"The Hissing of the Electric Arc\". Shortly thereafter, Ayrton was elected the first female member of the IEE; the next woman to be admitted to the IEE was in 1958. She petitioned to present a paper before the Royal Society but was not allowed because of her sex and \"The Mechanism of the Electric Arc\" was read by John Perry in her stead in 1901. Ayrton was also the first woman to win a prize from the Society, the Hughes Medal, awarded to her in 1906 in honour of her research on the motion of ripples in sand and water and her work on the electric arc. By the late nineteenth century, Ayrton\\'s work in the field of electrical engineering was recognised more widely, domestically and internationally. At the International Congress of Women held in London in 1899, she presided over the physical science section. Ayrton also spoke at the International Electrical Congress in Paris in 1900. Her success there led the British Association for the Advancement of Science to allow women to serve on general and sectional committees.\\nIn 1902, Ayrton published The Electric Arc, a summary of her research and work on the electric arc, with origins in her earlier articles from the Electrician published between 1895 and 1896. With this publication, her contribution to the field of electrical engineering began to be cemented. However, initially at least, Ayrton was not well received by the more prestigious and traditional scientific societies such as the Royal Society. In the aftermath of the publication of The Electric Arc, Ayrton was proposed as a Fellow of the Royal Society by renowned electrical engineer John Perry in 1902. Her application was turned down by the Council of the Royal Society, who decreed that married women were not eligible to be Fellows. However, in 1904, she became the first woman to read a paper before the Royal Society when she was allowed to read her paper \"The Origin and Growth of Ripple Marks\" and this was later published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society. In 1906, she was awarded the Royal Society\\'s prestigious Hughes Medal \"for her experimental investigations on the electric arc, and also on sand ripples.\" She was the fifth recipient of this prize, awarded annually since 1902, in recognition of an original discovery in the physical sciences, particularly electricity and magnetism or their applications, and as of 2015, one of only two women so honoured, the other being Michele Dougherty in 2008.\\n\\nLater life and research\\nAyrton delivered seven papers before the Royal Society between 1901 and 1926, the last posthumously.  She also presented the results of her research before audiences at the British Association and the Physical Society. Ayrton\\'s interest in vortices in water and air inspired the Ayrton fan, or flapper, used in the trenches in the First World War to dispel poison gas. Ayrton fought for its acceptance and organised its production, over 100,000 being used on the Western Front.\\nAyrton helped found the International Federation of University Women in 1919 and the National Union of Scientific Workers in 1920. She died of blood poisoning (resulting from an insect bite) on 26 August 1923 at New Cottage, North Lancing, Sussex.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nHertha Ayrton was agnostic. In her teens she adopted the name \"Hertha\" after the eponymous heroine of a poem by Algernon Charles Swinburne that criticised organised religion.\\nIn 1885, Ayrton married the widower William Edward Ayrton, a physicist and electrical engineer who was supportive of her scientific endeavours. Ayrton honoured Barbara Bodichon by naming her first child, a daughter born in 1886, Barbara Bodichon Ayrton (1886–1950). The daughter was called \"Barbie\", and she later became a member of parliament for the Labour Party. Her daughter\\'s son was the artist, Michael Ayrton.\\n\\nCommemoration\\nTwo years after her death in 1923, Ayrton\\'s lifelong friend Ottilie Hancock endowed the Hertha Ayrton Research Fellowship at Girton College. This fellowship continues today.\\nA blue plaque unveiled in 2007 commemorates Ayrton at 41 Norfolk Square in Paddington.\\nIn 2009, the Panasonic Trust inaugurated the Hertha Marks Ayrton Fellowship to mark the trust\\'s 25th anniversary. Its purpose is to promote the further education of under-represented groups in the engineering profession by supporting a suitably qualified engineer to study a full-time master\\'s degree course specifically related to sustainable development or some other environmental technology.\\nIn 2010, a panel of female Fellows of the Royal Society and science historians selected Ayrton as voted one of the ten most influential British women in the history of science.\\nIn 2015, the British Society for the History of Science created the Ayrton Prize for web projects and digital engagement in history of science. It awarded the inaugural prize to Voices of Science, a project of the British Library.\\nOn 28 April 2016, Google commemorated Ayrton\\'s 162nd birthday with a Google Doodle on its homepage.\\nIn 2016 the Council of the University of Cambridge approved the use of Ayrton\\'s name to mark a physical feature of the North West Cambridge Development.\\nIn 2017 Sheffield Hallam University named their new STEM centre after Ayrton.\\n\\nReferences\\nFurther reading\\nReminiscences of Hertha Ayrton by A.

It is contested whether she, or other Shakers, were the first to invent the circular saw. She was a member of the Harvard Shaker community.\\n\\nEarly life\\nBabbitt was born in Hardwick, Massachusetts, the daughter of Seth and Elizabeth Babbitt On August 12, 1793, she became a member of the Shakers at the Harvard Shaker community in Massachusetts.\\n\\nToolmaker and inventor\\nBabbitt, having realized a round blade would be more efficient, is credited with inventing the first circular saw used in a saw mill in 1813. The circular saw was hooked up to a water powered machine to reduce the effort to cut lumber. She was watching men use the difficult two-man whipsaw when she noticed that half of their motion was wasted. The first circular saw she made is in Albany, New York. She did not patent the circular saw so that it could be used by others, but it was patented in the United States by two French men three years later when they found out about the saw in Shaker papers.\\nM. Stephen Miller contends that Babbitt was not the first inventor of the circular saw, based upon the date that she joined the sect. He states that the circular saw was invented at Mount Lebanon Shaker Village by Amos Bishop or Benjamin Bruce in 1793 —or not by a Shaker at all.\\nIt is also claimed that she invented a process for the manufacture of false teeth and an improved spinning wheel head.\\nShe also shares the invention of cut nails with Eli Whitney. As a Shaker, Babbitt never patented any of her inventions.\\nShe died in Harvard, Massachusetts, in 1853.\\n\\nSee also\\nIsaac Babbitt, inventor of Babbitt metal alloy for bearings\\nShaker furniture\\n\\n\\n== References =='), (1013, 'Betty Lou Bailey (1929 – 2007) was a General Electric Company mechanical engineer from the United States. She held a patent for the converging diverging variable exhaust nozzle. The invention operated so that one would vary both the throat and the exit diameters for the hot gas flows. In honor of her legacy, the Society of Women Engineers named a scholarship after her. To date, that scholarship is still being distributed to eligible female graduate students who pursue a career in engineering.\\nBailey was the first female member of the Engineering Society of Cincinnati. She later served as the chair of its Guidance Committee.\\n\\nEarly life\\nBailey was the youngest of five children. She excelled in math and science in high school. Although her father was a civil engineer, it was her oldest sister Helen and her husband Paul who influenced Bailey to choose a career in engineering. Paul sold welding machines and taught Helen to weld. Helen taught welding to various men and women during World War II. Although a number of Helen\\'s female welding students scored higher than the male students, all of the men were placed first before the women, regardless of the score. So, between Betty Lou Bailey\\'s junior and senior years in high school, Helen suggested that Betty Lou should go into engineering.\\n\\nEducation\\nBailey attended the undergraduate program in mechanical engineering at the University of Illinois a year early, at the age of seventeen. By the time she finished her freshman year, both of Bailey\\'s parents had died. In 1950, Bailey graduated with University Honors. In her graduating class of approximately 700 engineers, she was the only female engineer. In her sorority, she was one out of a total of two engineers (the other one was a civil engineer). In 1967, she graduated from the Penn State Graduate Center in King of Prussia with a Masters in the Engineering Science.\\n\\nPersonal Life and Death\\nBailey was an active environmentalist. She enjoyed sewing. She traveled, canoed, cycled, and hiked. She walked the entire Appalachian Trail in segments over a few years. She was a member of the Adirondack Mountain Club (ADK). In 2004 she received their highest award for her work in monitoring hydropower applications to the Federal Regulatory Commission. She did work in dam-licensing that helped ensure that sufficient water was released downstream to support river life and water recreation.\\nBailey died suddenly on November 13, 2007, during an ADK cycling trip.\\n\\nCareer and Contributions\\nBailey held positions at General Electric Company as a testing, design, and systems engineer in their Large Jet Engine Department, Gas Turbine Department, and its Valley Forge Space Technology Center. She progressed in her work, from household appliances, to steam turbines and jet engineers, and finally to the NASA Nimbus weather satellite project. During her initial job interview with GE, which occurred before she graduated from the University of Illinois, she remarked that, \"I wanted to work for a company where engineers counted and were regarded as important.\"\\nIn addition to her work, Bailey started a math tournament in Cincinnati for high school students.\\n\\nExhaust Nozzle\\nDuring her tenure at General Electric, Bailey patented an exhaust nozzle in Evandale. She initiated the format that GE used for getting bids on their air emission tests.\\nThe company had the 7F gas turbine, which was the first-of-its-kind. She was working at the roof of the building and was familiar with enough with the piping to recognize a leak out of the gas line from the gas valve compartment. The company was losing a lot of gas that had already been counted as going into the turbine. Bailey noted the failed efficiency. That gas leak was going into the incoming gas in the machine, so the carbon monoxide was destroying the seal. All six weeks of prior combustion tests that the employees had been running on the machine had to be discarded. Her invention straightened out the problem, and they passed the tests after that. This was important because the company\\'s gas turbine was the first of its kind and would therefore need to pass all of its tests.\\n\\nSocieties\\nIn 1964, Bailey attended the first International Conference of Women Engineers and Scientists Conference in New York.\\nBailey joined the Society of Women Engineers in 1951, where she was an officer of the Philadelphia section and served on the SWE Executive Committee. In 1985, she was elected to the SWE College of Fellows. She was the first female member of the Engineering Society of Cincinnati and served as the chair of its Guidance Committee. She has also served on national committees for the National Society of Professional Engineers, the Engineers Joint Council, and the American Society for Engineering Education.\\n\\n\\n== References =='), (1014, 'Ellene Alice Bailey (1853 – July 22, 1897) was an American designer and inventor specializing in clothing and household goods. She patented over a dozen of her many inventions.\\n\\nBiography\\nEllene Alice Bailey was born in Pond Fort, just south of Wentzville, Missouri, the third daughter of Robert Bailey, a judge, and Lucinda (Zumwalt) Bailey. Early in her career, she moved to New York and built a business from manufacturing her own designs or selling them for outside manufacture.\\nBailey became a designer of clothing and household goods, as well as an inventor of practical devices. Her first design was the \"Pond Fort boot\", a close-fitting, knee-high boot that she patented in both the United States and Canada in 1880. Later clothing designs included a perforated felt chest protector, a sleeve holder, a waterproof leg protector, a detachable brassiere frame, and a corset shield.\\nOne of her early inventions was the \"Dart\" needle, first patented in 1884. She initially manufactured the Dart needle herself, making the first 60,000 on her own after the man she hired for the job absconded. She later had the needle manufactured by an outside firm. Other practical objects for the home included a holder for rubber overshoes, a manicure case, a photograph album, several clocks, ornamental tables, and a hand pinking device. A number of Bailey\\'s inventions were novelty or seasonal goods, such as a silver whisk broom and a music roll sold as a Christmas card. On occasion, she improved designs originated by other inventors to make them salable.\\nBailey may have been the first American to patent a powder puff with her 1882 invention of a small drawstring cloth bag with a perforated bottom to distributed the powder evenly. She went on to invent three more variations on her powder puff, the last of them patented in 1892.\\n\\n\\n== References =='), (1015, ''), (1016, 'Alice Pike Barney (born Alice Pike; 1857–1931) was an American painter. She was active in Washington, D.C. and worked to make Washington into a center of the arts. Her two daughters were the writer and salon hostess Natalie Clifford Barney and the Bahá\\'í writer Laura Clifford Barney.\\n\\nEarly life\\nBarney\\'s father Samuel Napthali Pike, who had made his fortune as the distiller of Magnolia brand whiskey, was a patron of the arts in Cincinnati, Ohio, where he built Pike\\'s Opera House. His father was a German Jew, and his mother a Dutch Christian. Alice Pike Barney\\'s mother was of French descent. After the family moved New York City in 1866, he built what would become the Grand Opera House at Twenty-Third Street and Eighth Avenue. Barney was the youngest of four children and the only one who fully shared her father\\'s cultural interests; as a child she showed talent as a singer and pianist.\\nAt 17 she became engaged to the explorer Henry Morton Stanley. Alice\\'s mother considered the match unsuitable due to the age difference – she was 17, he 33 – and insisted that they wait to marry. While he was away on a three-year expedition in Africa (he named the boat in which he circled Lake Victoria The Lady Alice), she instead married Albert Clifford Barney, son of a wealthy manufacturer of railway cars in Dayton, Ohio.\\nIn 1882 Barney and her family spent the summer at New York\\'s Long Beach Hotel, where Oscar Wilde happened to be speaking on his American lecture tour. Wilde spent the day with Alice and her daughter Natalie on the beach; their conversation changed the course of Alice\\'s life, inspiring her to pursue art seriously despite her husband\\'s disapproval.\\n\\nNew Woman\\nAs educational opportunities were made more available in the 19th-century, women artists became part of professional enterprises, including founding their own art associations. Artwork made by women was considered to be inferior, and to help overcome that stereotype women became \"increasingly vocal and confident\" in promoting women\\'s work, and thus became part of the emerging image of the educated, modern and freer \"New Woman\". Artists the, \"played crucial roles in representing the New Woman, both by drawing images of the icon and exemplifying this emerging type through their own lives.\" In the late 19th-century and early 20th century about 88% of the subscribers of 11,000 magazines and periodicals were women.\\n\\nStudy of art\\nIn 1887 she travelled to Paris to be nearer her two daughters while they attended Les Ruches, a French boarding school founded by the feminist educator Marie Souvestre. While there, she studied painting with Carolus-Duran. She returned to Paris in 1896 – bringing her daughter Laura to a French hospital for treatment of leg pain from a childhood injury – and resumed her study with Carolus-Duran as well as taking lessons from the Spanish painter Claudio Castelucho. When James Abbott McNeill Whistler opened an academie, she was one of the first students. Whistler soon lost interest in teaching art and the school shut down, but he was a formative influence.\\nIn 1899 she began a salon at her rented home on the Avenue Victor Hugo; regular guests included the Symbolist painters Lucien Lévy-Dhurmer, John White Alexander, and Edmond Aman-Jean, and her art began to show a Symbolist influence.\\nWhen Natalie wrote a chapbook of French poetry, Quelques Portraits-Sonnets de Femmes (Some Portrait-Sonnets of Women), Barney was pleased to provide illustrations. She did not understand the implications of the book\\'s love poems addressed to women and had no idea that three of the four women who modeled for her were her daughter\\'s lovers. Albert, alerted to the book\\'s theme by a newspaper review headlined \"Sappho Sings in Washington\", rushed to Paris, where he bought and destroyed the publisher\\'s remaining stock and printing plates and insisted that Barney and Natalie return with him to the family\\'s summer home in Bar Harbor, Maine. His temper only worsened when friends forwarded him clippings from the Washington Mirror.\\nWashington, about to publish its first Social Register, was becoming more socially stratified, and Barney\\'s background as the daughter of a whiskey distiller and granddaughter of a Jewish immigrant had made her the subject of vague insinuations in the society pages. The gossip would have no lasting effect on the Barneys\\' social standing, but Albert considered it a disaster. His drinking increased, as did his blood pressure, and two months later he had a heart attack. His health continued to deteriorate, and he died in 1902.\\nBarney had solo shows at major galleries including the Corcoran Gallery of Art. In later years, she invented and patented mechanical devices, wrote and performed in several plays and an opera, and worked to promote the arts in Washington, D.C. Many of her paintings are now in the collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum.\\nShe converted to the Bahá\\'í Faith around 1900.\\n\\nLater life\\nIn 1911, at age 53, Barney married 23-year-old Christian Hemmick; their engagement resulted in worldwide press attention. They had divorced by 1920.\\n\\nSee also\\nNational Sylvan Theater\\nAlice Pike Barney Studio House\\n\\nReferences\\nBibliography\\nKling, Jean L. (1994). Alice Pike Barney: Her Life and Art.

She has broken ground for women and African Americans in a number of areas. Prior to Bath, no woman served on the staff of the Jules Stein Eye Institute, lead a post-graduate training program in ophthalmology, or elected to the honorary staff of the UCLA Medical Center (an honor bestowed on her after her retirement). Bath was the first black person to serve as a resident in ophthalmology at New York University. She is also the first black woman to serve on staff as a surgeon at the UCLA Medical Center. Bath is the first African-American woman doctor to receive a patent for a medical purpose. The holder of four patents, she also founded the non-profit American Institute for the Prevention of Blindness in Washington, D.C.\\n\\nEarly life and education\\nBorn on November 4, 1942, in Harlem, Manhattan, Bath is the daughter of Rupert and Gladys Bath. Her father, an immigrant from Trinidad, a newspaper columnist, a merchant seaman and the first black man to work for the New York City Subway as a motorman. Her father inspired her love for culture and encouraged Bath to explore different cultures. Her mother descended from African slaves. She decided to be a homemaker while her children were young, then later became a housekeeper to help fund her children\\'s educations. She was encouraged academically by her parents. It was evident by Bath\\'s teachers that she was a gifted student and pushed her to explore her strengths in school in science. With the help of a microscope set she was given as a young child, Bath knew she had a love for math and science. Bath attended Charles Evans Hughes High School where she excelled at such a rapid pace. She obtained her diploma in just two and a half years.\\n\\nInspired by Albert Schweitzer\\'s work in medicine, Bath applied for and won a National Science Foundation Scholarship while attending high school; this led her to a research project at Yeshiva University and Harlem Hospital Center on connection between cancer, nutrition and stress which helped her interest in science shift to medicine. The head of the researched program realized the significance to her findings during the research and published them in a scientific paper that he later presented. In 1960, still a teenager, Bath won the \"Merit Award\" of Mademoiselle magazine for her contribution to the project.\\nBath received her Bachelor of Arts in chemistry from Manhattan\\'s Hunter College in 1964. She relocated to Washington, D.C. to attend Howard University College of Medicine to receive her doctoral degree in 1968. During her time at Howard, she was President of the Student National Medical Association and received fellowships from the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Mental Health.\\nBath interned at Harlem Hospital Center, subsequently serving as a fellow at Columbia University. Bath traveled to Yugoslavia in 1967 to study children\\'s health which caused her to become aware that the practice of eye care was uneven among racial minorities and poor populations, with much higher incidence of blindness among her black and poor patients. She determined that, as a physician, she would help address this issue. It was also not easy for her to go to medical school since her family did not have the funds for it.She persuaded her professors from Columbia to operate on blind patients at Harlem Hospital Center, which had not previously offered eye surgery, at no cost. Bath pioneered the worldwide discipline of \"community ophthalmology\", a volunteer-based outreach to bring necessary eye care to underserved populations.\\nShe served her residency in ophthalmology at New York University from 1970 to 1973, the first African American to do so in her field.\\n\\nCareer\\nAfter completing her education, Bath served briefly as an assistant professor at Jules Stein Eye Institute at UCLA and Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science before becoming the first woman on faculty at the Eye Institute. In 1978, Bath co-founded the American Institute for the Prevention of Blindness, for which she served as president. In 1983, she became the head of a residency in her field at Charles R. Drew, the first woman ever to head such a department. In 1993, she retired from UCLA, which subsequently elected her the first woman on its honorary staff.\\nShe served as a professor of Ophthalmology at Howard University\\'s School of Medicine and as a professor of Telemedicine and Ophthalmology at St. Georges University. She was among the co-founders of the King-Drew Medical Center ophthalmology training program.\\nBath has lectured internationally and authored over 100 papers.\\n\\nInventions\\nBath holds four patents in the United States. In 1981, she conceived the Laserphaco Probe, a medical device that improves on the use of lasers to remove cataracts, and \"for ablating and removing cataract lenses\". The device was completed in 1986 after Bath conducted research on lasers in Berlin and patented in 1988, making her the first African-American woman to receive a patent for a medical purpose. The device — which quickly and nearly painlessly dissolves the cataract with a laser, irrigates and cleans the eye and permits the easy insertion of a new lens — is used internationally to treat the disease. Bath has continued to improve the device and has successfully restored vision to people who have been unable to see for decades.\\nThree of Bath\\'s four patents relate to the Laserphaco Probe. In 2000, she was granted a patent for a method she devised for using ultrasound technology to treat cataracts.\\n\\nHonors\\nBath has been honored by two of her universities. Hunter College placed her in its \"hall of fame\" in 1988 and Howard University declared her a \"Howard University Pioneer in Academic Medicine\" in 1993.

She held 55 patents.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nRuth Mary Rogan benerito was born and raised in New Orleans. Her father, John Edward Rogan, was a civil engineer and railroad official and was described by his daughter as a pioneer in women\\'s liberation. Her mother, Bernadette Rogan, was an artist and considered a \"truly liberated woman\" by her daughter. Both parents were college graduates and imposed their values regarding a strong sense of education and women\\'s rights onto Ruth. The Great Depression era surrounded Ruth\\'s early years and when she eventually received her B.S. in Chemistry, 1 in 5 Americans was unemployed. Ruth\\'s original interest preceding chemistry was math, however she did not want to foster a career as an actuary simply estimating probabilities for insurance companies, which led her to study chemistry.\\nLater in her life as she reflected on her many achievements, the true essence of her character was illustrated when she said, \"I believe that whatever success that I have attained is the result of many efforts of many [people]. My very personal success was built from the help and sacrifices of members of my family, and professional accomplishments resulted from the efforts of early teachers and the cooperativeness of colleagues too many to enumerate.\"\\n\\nEducation\\nIn an age when girls did not usually go on to higher education, her father made sure his daughters received the same education available to boys. She completed high school at age 14 and entered Sophie Newcomb College, the women\\'s college at Tulane University, at age 15 where she earned a degree in chemistry, as well as physics and math. She graduated in 1935 and moved to Bryn Mawr College to complete one year of graduate studies. She then moved to Newcomb, where she taught chemistry while researching advanced quantitative analysis and physical chemistry, organic chemistry, kinetics, and thermodynamics. While working as a teacher, Benerito took night classes to earn her master\\'s degree from Tulane University. In 1948 she received her doctorate degree from the University of Chicago, where she conducted physical chemical research under the direction of Thomas F. Young. Her Ph.D dissertation was titled \"Activity Coefficients of HCl in Ternary Aqueous Solutions\". She left her job as an assistant professor in Newcomb College in 1953 to go work at the USDA Southern Regional Research Center of the US Department of Agriculture in New Orleans, where she spent most of her career.\\nAt the USDA she worked in the Intravenous Fat Program of the OilSeed Laboratory and in 1955 she was promoted project leader. In 1958 she was promoted acting head of the Colloid Cotton Chemical Laboratory and in 1959 she became the research leader of the Physical Chemistry Research Group of the Cotton Reaction Laboratory. Benerito completed a postdoc in 1972 in biophysics at Tulane University. Still at Tulane, she was an adjunct professor from 1960-1981. During that time, she also worked as a lecturer at the University of New Orleans.In later years, while she was researching cotton fibers, Benerito taught classes part-time at Tulane University and at the University of New Orleans. She retired from the USDA in 1986 but continued to teach part-time at Tulane and the University of New Orleans.\\n\\nContributions\\nInvention of wrinkle-free cotton\\nBenerito is most famous for her work relating to the use of mono-basic acid chlorides in the production of cotton, with which she has 55 patents, which allows for more wrinkle-free and durable clothing. She invented these wash-and-wear cotton fabrics while working at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) laboratories in New Orleans in the 1950s. Before this innovation, a family needed considerable time to iron clothes. Benerito found a way to chemically treat the surface of cotton that led not only to wrinkle-resistant fabric but also to stain- and flame-resistant fabrics. The invention was said to have \"saved the cotton industry.\"\\nWhile she is publicly credited for the invention of winkle-free fiber, she did not believe she singlehandedly invented it and clarified her role in a 2004 USDA interview by stating, \"I don\\'t like it to be said that I invented wash-wear because there were any number of people worked on it and the various processes by which you give cotton those properties. No one person discovered it or is responsible for it, but I contributed to a new process of doing it.\"\\nThe secret of the invention is the use of a process called crosslinking. Cotton is composed of a material called cellulose. Like synthetic nylon and polyester fibers, cellulose is a polymer; that is, its molecules are shaped like long chains containing many thousands of atoms. The long, chainlike shape of the molecules is what makes cellulose, like nylon and polyester, a good fiber. She discovered a way to treat cotton fibers so that the chainlike cellulose molecules were joined together chemically. This procedure is known as crosslinking, and it makes cotton resistant to wrinkling.\\nIt was first thought that crosslinking was making the cotton fabric wrinkle resistant by strengthening its fibers, but the amount of crosslinking used in her treatment is small and does not add much strength. She developed a new theory on how crosslinking works. It is known that cellulose molecules can stick to each other by means of the weak hydrogen bonds between molecules. She proposed that one side effect of her crosslinking process was the strengthening of the hydrogen bonds, which made the material resistant to wrinkling.\\n\\nLaboratory Equipment\\nBenerito\\'s research led to the development of glassy fibers that proved useful in the manufacture of laboratory equipment.\\n\\nMethod feeding seriously wounded soldiers\\nBesides her contribution to textile industry, during the Korean War, she developed a way to give fat intravenously to patients who were too sick to eat—a method used to feed seriously wounded soldiers.\\n\\nAwards\\n1964 USDA Distinguished Service Award\\n1968 Federal Woman Award\\n1968 Southern Chemist Award\\n1970 Garvan Medal\\n1971 Southwest Regional Award of American Chemical Society\\n1981 Honorary degree, Tulane University\\n1984 Woman of Achievement at Worlds Fair\\n2002 Lemelson-MIT Lifetime Achievement Award\\n2008 National Inventors Hall of Fame induction\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\n2008 Chicago Tribune biography\\nPatents by Inventor Ruth R.

On July 17, 1888 she obtained a patent for her invention, the Gong and Signal Chair for Hotels. The chair would \"reduce the expenses of hotels by decreasing the number of waiters and attendants, to add to the convenience and comfort of guests and to obviate the necessity of hand clapping or calling aloud to obtain the services of pages.\" The chair worked when the person sitting would press a small button on the back of the chair which would then send a signal to a waiting attendant. A light would illuminate as well, allowing the attendant to see which guest needed help. The system was eventually adopted by the United States House of Representatives and was a precursor to the signaling system used on airplanes for passengers to seek assistance from flight attendants.\\n\\nLife and career\\nMiriam Elizabeth Benjamin was born, a free black woman, in Charleston, South Carolina in 1861, the eldest of five children of Francis Benjamin and Eliza (Hopkins) Benjamin. In 1873, the Benjamin family moved to Boston, Massachusetts, where she attended high school. She moved to Washington, D.C. where she was a schoolteacher in the segregated municipal school system. In 1888, she was living at 1736 New York Avenue, N.W. in Washington.\\nMiriam Benjamin briefly attended Howard University\\'s medical school, but after passing a competitive civil service examination and working as a government clerk in a number of federal departments, she enrolled in the law school of Howard University; upon graduation, she set herself up in business as a \"solicitor of patents.\"\\nIn 1920, she returned to Boston, where she lived and worked with her brother, Boston attorney Edgar P. Benjamin. Along with Sarah Boone, Ellen Eglin, and Sarah Goode, Boone was one of four African American women inventors of her time who developed new technology for the home.\\nShe died in 1947.\\n\\nFamily\\nMiriam Benjamin never married. For most of her life she lived with her widowed mother Eliza Jane (Hopkins) Benjamin (1840–1934) in the Boston area.\\nShe had four siblings. Her sisters were Charlotte D. \"Lottie\" Benjamin (1863–1928, m. Walter W. Sampson, 1889, no children) and Eva S.

Although best remembered for establishing the Resthaven Nursing Home (now the Benjamin Healthcare Center) in Roxbury, Massachusetts, he also held a U.S. Patent; on May 31, 1892, he was awarded U.S. patent no. 475,749 for a \"Trousers-Shield,\" or, a bicycle clip.\\n\\n\\n== References =='), (1022, 'Amalie Auguste Melitta Bentz (31 January 1873 – 29 June 1950), born Amalie Auguste Melitta Liebscher, was a German entrepreneur who invented the coffee filter in 1908.\\n\\nBiography\\nBentz was born in Dresden. Her father was a publisher.\\nAs a housewife, Bentz found that percolators were prone to over-brewing the coffee, espresso-type machines at the time tended to leave grounds in the drink, and linen bag filters were tiresome to clean. She experimented with many means, but ended up using blotting paper from her son Willi\\'s school exercise book and a brass pot perforated using a nail. When the grounds-free, less bitter coffee met with general enthusiasm, she decided to set up a business. The Kaiserliche Patentamt (Imperial Patent Office) granted her a patent on 20 June 1908, and on 15 December the company was entered into the commercial register with 73 Pfennig as \"M. Bentz.\" After contracting a tinsmith to manufacture the devices, they sold 1,200 coffee filters at the 1909 Leipzig fair.\\nHer husband Hugo and their sons Horst and Willi were the first employees of the emerging company. In 1910, the company won a gold medal at the International Health Exhibition and a silver medal at the Saxon Innkeepers\\' Association. When the First World War erupted, metals were requisitioned for use in zeppelin construction, her husband was conscripted to Romania, paper was rationed, and coffee beans import was impossible due to the British blockade, disrupting the normal business. During this time she supported herself by selling cartons.\\nContinuing expansion caused them to move their business several times within Dresden. By 1928 the demand for their products was so high that the 80 workers had to work in a double-shift system. As no satisfactory production facilities could be found in Dresden, the fast-growing company moved in 1929 to Minden in eastern Westphalia. By that time 100,000 filters had been produced.\\nHorst took over the company, now \"Bentz & Sohn,\" in 1930. She transferred the majority stake in Melitta-Werke Aktiengesellschaft to Horst and Willi in 1932, but kept a hand in the business, ensuring that the employees were cared for, offering Christmas bonuses, increasing vacation days from 6 to 15 days per year, and reducing the working week to 5 days. Bentz fostered the company\\'s “Melitta Aid” system, a social fund for company employees.\\nAfter the outbreak of World War II, production stopped and the company was ordered to produce goods to aid the war effort. At the conclusion of war, the workers relocated for a time to old factories, barracks, even pubs, because the surviving portions of the main factory had been requisitioned as a provisional administration for the Allied troops, a condition that held for twelve years. By 1948, production of filters and paper had resumed, and at the time of her death at Holzhausen at Porta Westfalica in 1950, the company had reached 4.7 million Deutsche marks.\\n\\nLegacy\\nThe grandchildren of Melitta Bentz, Thomas and Stephen Bentz, still control the Melitta Group KG headquartered in Minden in the east of North Rhine-Westphalia, with some 3,300 employees in 50 companies.\\n\\nSee also\\nGerman inventors and discoverers\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nMelitta 100 Jahre: Company History'), (1023, 'Theresa Berkley or Berkeley (died September 1836) was a 19th-century English dominatrix who ran a brothel in Hallam Street, just to the east of Portland Place, Marylebone, London, specialising in flagellation. She is notable as the inventor of the \"chevalet\" or \"Berkley Horse\", a BDSM apparatus.\\n\\nCareer as a dominatrix\\nTheresa Berkley ran a high-class flagellation brothel at 28 Charlotte Street (which is today\\'s 84–94 Hallam Street). She was a \"governess\", i.e. she specialised in chastisement, whipping, flagellation, and the like. She invented the \"Berkley Horse\", an apparatus that reportedly earned her a fortune in flogging wealthy men and women of the time. There are no artworks depicting what Theresa Berkley looked like, and occasional descriptions usually report that she was attractive, with a strong disposition. An expert with all instruments of torture, her talents became highly sought after by the aristocracy of the day. She was a master of the art of inflicting pain for pleasure, and practised absolute privacy to protect her clientele. Her clients were said to have been both men and women of wealth, and her career was financially lucrative. Her fame was such that the pornographic novel Exhibition of Female Flagellants was attributed to her, probably falsely.\\nOne writer said of her:\\n\\nShe possessed the first requisite of a courtezan, viz., lewdness; for without a woman is positively lecherous she cannot keep up the affectation of it, and it will soon be perceived that she moves her hands or her buttocks to the tune of pounds, shillings, and pence.\\n\\nQuotes related to her deeds of domination and sexual torture\\nAccording to an unnamed source quoted by Henry Spencer Ashbee:\\n\\n\"Her instruments of torture were more numerous than those of any other governess. Her supply of birch was extensive, and kept in water, so that it was always green and pliant: she had shafts with a dozen whip thongs on each of them; a dozen different sizes of cat-o\\'-nine-tails, some with needle points worked into them; various kinds of thin bending canes; leather straps like coach traces; battledoors, made of thick sole-leather, with inch nails run through to docket, and currycomb tough hides rendered callous by many years flagellation. Holly brushes, furze brushes; a prickly evergreen, called butcher\\'s bush [?butcher\\'s broom]; and during the summer, a glass and China vases, filled with a constant supply of green nettles, with which she often restored the dead to life. Thus, at her shop, whoever went with plenty of money, could be birched, whipped, fustigated, scourged, needle-pricked, half-hung, holly-brushed, furze-brushed, butcher-brushed, stinging-nettled, curry-combed, phlebotomized, and tortured till he had a belly full.\"\\n\\n\"Mrs Berkley has also in her second floor, a hook and pulley attached to the ceiling, by which she could draw a man up by his hands. This operation is also represented in her memoirs.\"\\n\\nShe enjoyed a certain amount of torture inflicted on her by her clients, given that they were willing to pay her price, but she also employed a number of women for that task if indeed her clients wished to inflict more pain than she was willing to take herself. As reflected in the below quote:\\n\\n\"For those whose lech it was to flog a woman, she would herself submit to a certain extent; but if they were gluttons at it, she had women in attendance who would take any number of lashes the flogger pleased, provided he forked out an ad valorem duty. Among these were Miss Ring, Hannah Jones, Sally Taylor, One-eyed Peg, Bauld-cunted Poll, and a black girl, called Ebony Bet.\"\\n\\nAfter her death\\nShortly after her death in 1836, her brother, who had been a missionary for 30 years in Australia, arrived in England. When he learned the source from which the property she had left him had been derived, he renounced all claim, and immediately went back to Australia. In default, the property was bequeathed to Dr Vance, her medical attendant and executor; but he refused to administer, and the whole estate, valued at £100,000, was escheated to the crown.\\nDr Vance came into possession of her correspondence, several boxes, which was said to have contained letters from the highest aristocracy, both male and female, in the land.

She was the inventor of the first long-lasting lipstick.\\n\\nEarly life\\nBishop was born in Hoboken, New Jersey and was one of two children of Henry and Mabel Bishop. Her father was a businessman and ran a dozen successful enterprises that included numerous stores in Hoboken. She attended Barnard College in New York, originally enrolling in pre-med, with intentions of becoming a physician. She was graduated from Barnard in 1929 with a B.A. in chemistry, with plans on attending Columbia for her graduate medical studies. She intended to begin graduate classes in the fall of 1929, but the stock market crash that occurred in October of that same year resulted in the end of her academic career.\\n\\nCareer\\nFrom 1935-1942, she worked as research assistant to A.B. Cannon in a dermatological laboratory at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. In 1942, she worked as an organic chemist for Standard Oil Development Company designing fuels for airplanes during World War II. During her time there she discovered the cause of deposits affecting superchargers of aircraft engines. In 1945, she joined the Socony Vacuum Oil Company, where she worked until 1950.\\n\\nLipstick invention\\nBishop was inspired by her mother\\'s advice to \"open your own business, even if it\\'s only a peanut stand\", and begun conducting experiments on her own time. In the 1930s, she developed a pimple concealer and mentholated tissues, which never went to market, but . Aiming to appeal to a wider market, Bishop began experimenting in her own small kitchen with staining dyes, oils, and molten wax. The goal was a non-drying, smudge-proof, long-lasting lipstick that would not smear on clothing or cups. The resultant mixture, formed into a mold, was called \"No-Smear Lipstick\".\\nIn 1948, she and Alfred Berg founded Hazel Bishop Inc. to manufacture these \"No-Smear Lipsticks\". The lipstick debuted at Barnard College Club of New York in 1949 and in stores in 1950. The brand was unveiled in the summer of 1950 at Lord & Taylor, where the lipstick tubes sold for $1 each. The product proved to be a success, selling out on its first day of launch. Bishop and Berg then turned to Raymond Spector, an advertiser, to help market the lipstick to consumers, giving Spector shares in the company rather than a specified budget.\\nIn 1951, Bishop becoming the first woman to appear solo on the cover of Business Week.\\nBishop\\'s innovative use of bromo acids would set in motion what would be known as the \"lipstick wars\". with competitors such as Revlon making their own versions of Bishop\\'s formula in an attempt to combat her impact on the cosmetics scene. The advent of the \"no smear\" lipstick would prove to be a success for Bishop, as her debut line would not only sell out on the first day, but end up taking over 25% of the American lipstick market.\\nInternal struggles within the company lead to Bishop losing control of the company in 1954 in a proxy fight with majority stockholders, led by Spector. The case was settled on February 17, 1954, with the company (of which Spector was chairman and holder of 92% of the stock) purchasing Bishop\\'s 8% of company stock, with the stipulation that she refrain from selling products under her own name and that she make clear in future ventures that she was no longer associated with Hazel Bishop, Inc.[4]\\nAfter leaving the company, she became a consultant to the National Association of Leather Glove Manufacturers and developed \"Leather Lav,\" a leather glove cleaner.

As of 2014, she is listed as the 93rd most powerful woman in the world by Forbes.\\n\\nEarly life\\nBlakely was born February 27, 1971, in Clearwater, Florida. She is the daughter of Ellen (née Ford), an artist, and trial attorney, John Blakely. She has a brother, artist Ford Blakely. She attended Clearwater High School and graduated from Florida State University with a communication degree, where she was a member of the Delta Delta Delta sorority.\\n\\nCareer\\nAlthough she initially planned to become an attorney, she reconsidered after placing very low on the Law School Admission Test; she instead accepted a job at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, where she worked for three months. She also occasionally worked as a stand-up comedian during this period.\\nAfter her short stint at Disney, Blakely accepted a job with office supply company Danka, where she sold fax machines door-to-door. She was quite successful in sales and was promoted to national sales trainer at the age of 25. Forced to wear pantyhose in the hot Floridian climate for her sales role, Blakely disliked the appearance of the seamed foot while wearing open-toed shoes, but liked the way that the control-top model eliminated panty lines and made her body appear firmer. For her attendance at a private party, she experimented by cutting off the feet of her pantyhose while wearing them under a new pair of slacks and found that the pantyhose continuously rolled up her legs, but she also achieved the desired result (the original pants are now enshrined at Spanx headquarters).\\nAt age 27, Blakely relocated to Atlanta, Georgia, and while still working at Danka, spent the next two years and $5,000 savings researching and developing her hosiery idea.\\nBlakely then drove to North Carolina, the location of most of America\\'s hosiery mills, to present her idea. She was turned away by every representative; these companies were used to dealing with established companies, and did not see the value of her idea. Two weeks after arriving home from her North Carolina trip, Blakely received a call from a male mill operator based in Asheboro, North Carolina, who offered to support Blakely\\'s concept, as he had received strong encouragement from his three daughters. Blakely further explained in 2011 that the experience of developing her idea also revealed to her that the hosiery manufacturing industry was overseen solely by men who were not using the products they were producing.\\nThe creation of the initial product prototype was completed over the course of a year.\\nBlakely then returned to a patent attorney to finalize her application prior to her submission to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and he agreed to assist Blakely for a sum of US$750. Following the submission of the online application, Blakely then worked on the packaging of her product.\\nBlakely then used her credit card to purchase the \"Spanx\" trademark on the USPTO website for US$150.\\nBlakely managed to arrange a meeting with a representative of the Neiman Marcus Group, at which she changed into the product in the ladies restroom in the presence of the Neiman Marcus buyer to prove the benefits of her innovation. Blakely\\'s product was sold in seven Neiman Marcus stores as a result of the meeting; Bloomingdales, Saks, and Bergdorf Goodman soon followed. At around this time, Blakely sent a basket of products to Oprah Winfrey\\'s television program, with a gift card that explained what she was attempting to develop.\\nBlakely initially handled all aspects of the business, including marketing, logistics and product positioning, preferring the location of Spanx alongside shoes in retail outlets, rather than in hosiery sections; however, her boyfriend at the time, a healthcare consultant, later resigned from his job and joined Blakely in the running of the nascent business. Blakely was contacting friends and acquaintances, including those from her past, and asking them to seek out her products at select department stores in exchange for a check that she would send to them by mail as a token of appreciation.\\nIn November 2000, Winfrey named Spanx a \"Favorite Thing\", leading to a significant rise in popularity and sales, as well as Blakely\\'s resignation from Danka. Spanx achieved US$4 million in sales in its first year and US$10 million in sales in its second year. In 2001, Blakely signed a contract with QVC, the home shopping channel, and sold 8,000 pairs in the first six minutes of operation.\\nIn October 2013, Blakely explained that her ambition is to design the world\\'s most comfortable high-heel shoe prior to retirement. As of 2014, she is listed as the 93rd most powerful woman in the world by Forbes.\\n\\nAtlanta Hawks\\nIn 2015, Blakely and her husband Jesse Itzler were part of a group led by Tony Ressler along with Grant Hill, Steven Price, and Rick Schnall, that successfully purchased the Atlanta Hawks for $850 million.\\n\\nTelevision\\nIn 2005, Blakely attained second place as a contestant on The Rebel Billionaire, a reality television series that introduced her to Richard Branson, who later supported Blakely in her endeavors as both an entrepreneur and philanthropist. She later starred as one of the judges on ABC\\'s reality television series, American Inventor, alongside George Foreman, Pat Croce and Peter Jones.\\nShe was a guest investor on several episodes in season 9 of Shark Tank.\\nShe also appeared in a guest role, for a couple of seconds, in Season 3 Episode 12 (Elmsley Count) of \\'Billions\\' as herself.\\n\\nPhilanthropy\\nIn 2006, Blakely launched the Sara Blakely Foundation to help women through education and entrepreneurial training—Blakely had considered the establishment of a non-profit foundation prior to the founding of Spanx. Richard Branson acted as a mentor to Blakely and, at the conclusion of The Rebel Billionaire, surprised Blakely with a US$750,000 check to start the Foundation.\\nSince its launch, The Sara Blakely Foundation has funded scholarships for young women at the Community and Individual Development Association City Campus in South Africa and Blakely appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2006, donating US$1 million to the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls. In 2013 Blakely became the first female billionaire to join the \"Giving Pledge\", Bill Gates and Warren Buffett\\'s pledge, whereby the world\\'s richest people donate at least half of their wealth to charity.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nIn 2008, Blakely married Jesse Itzler, the co-founder of Marquis Jet, at the Gasparilla Inn and Club in Boca Grande, Florida, U.S. The wedding was attended by actor Matt Damon and featured a surprise performance by singer Olivia Newton-John. Blakely has four children. She is a convert to Judaism.\\n\\nSee also\\nWomen in business\\nIntellectual property\\n\\nReferences\\nBibliography\\nL\\'Ambition, ou l\\'épopée de soi, Vincent Cespedes, Paris, Flammarion, 2013, p. 263-273.\\n\\nExternal links\\nSara Blakely Foundation'), (1027, \"Helen Augusta Blanchard (25 October 1840 – January 12, 1922) was an American inventor who received 28 patents between 1873 and 1915. She was known for her numerous inventions dealing with sewing machines and sewing technology.\\n\\nEarly life\\nBlanchard was born in Portland, Maine on October 25, 1840 to a wealthy family. Her father was Nathaniel Blanchard, a shipowner and businessman; her mother was Phoebe Buxton Blanchard. Helen was one of six children; two other daughters Louise Phobe, and Persis E., and three sons David H., Augustus, and Albus. Helen demonstrated an inventive turn of mind at an early age, but did not receive her first patent until she was over thirty, after the fall of her father's business. There is no indication that she received any mechanical or technical education, despite her patents being involved mostly in these subjects.\\n\\nFirst inventions and move to Boston – 1870s\\nHer father suffered financial losses as a result of the business panic of 1866, resulting in the loss of the family homestead. Nathaniel died, leaving his family with financial troubles. Helen Blanchard moved to Boston, Massachusetts and patented several inventions relating to sewing machines in 1873 and 1875. This included the Blanchard over-seaming-machine, which could simultaneously sew and trim knitted fabrics.\\n\\nPhiladelphia and New York – late 1870s–1890s\\nAfter developing techniques for zigzag stitching and overseaming, Blanchard moved to Philadelphia, where she established the Blanchard Overseaming Company of Philadelphia to market her inventions in the late 1870s or early 1880s. She also founded the Blanchard Hosiery Machine Company in 1882. She moved to New York in the early 1890s, and continued to patent a variety of inventions, including a pencil sharpener  and a hat sewing machine.\\n\\nLater life and legacy\\nHaving profited from her commercial ventures, Blanchard was able to buy back the family homestead in Portland, and moved back there in 1901. She continued to patent inventions until suffering a stroke in 1916. She died in Providence, RI, in 1922 and is buried in the family plot in Portland’s Evergreen Cemetery. . It is unclear what became of her property and wealth after her death. However, she was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2006.\\n\\nPatents\\nHelen Blanchard received 28 patents over about 45 years, 22 of which involved sewing and sewing machines. Many of these inventions have been referenced by other inventors in their own designs.\\n1873-Improvement in Sewing Machines\\nThis invention created a way to form a button-hole stitch, or a zig-zag stitch, that when used to close a seam gave strength to the piece. The stitch could be varied in several different ways, such as varying the depth of the needle. The original sewing machine with this adaptation is currently housed in the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.\\n1875- Improvement in Elastic Seams for Garments\\nThis invention is a method of stitching that produces a strong elastic stitch with minimal alterations to the material used in the process besides adjusting the tension of the fabric.\\n1875- Improvement in Elastic Goring for Shoes\\nThis invention is a way to strengthen shoes by reinforcing the goring keeping the pieces of shoe together. A series of rows of stitches made from one strand of regular thread and one rubber thread is used to create a type of goring that could withstand more movement compared to the previous method.\\n1876- Improvement in Welted and Covered Seams\\nThis invention is a method for which two edges of material, once stitched together to form a seam, could be made flat. This could be done by either inserting a welt or by sewing a strip over the seam.\\n1883- Spool Case\\nThis invention is a simple cover for spools of silk, cotton, thread, or other material, that protects the spool from becoming dirty, damaged, or unwound.\\n1893- Method of Securing Reeds or Cords to the Edges of Material\\nThis invention is a method of securing reeds or cords to the edges of materials, especially securing reeds to hat sweat bands. This is done by folding the edges of the material around the reed or cord before sewing.\\n1893- Sewing-Needle\\nThis invention is an improvement to the sewing needle, by making it possible to thread the needle with one hand for efficiency. This is done by adding a latch that allows the needle to open, making it possible for the user to place the thread in the slot instead of threading it through a hole.\\n1894- Surgical Needle\\nThis invention is an improvement to previous surgical needles. The needle has a lancet point which allows it to pierce skin easily with minimal resistance and therefore less pain to the patient. The notch on the backside of the needle allows the thread to disconnect from the needle by just withdrawing from the skin.\\n1900- Sewing Machine Needle\\nThis invention is a type of needle used in sewing machines where one or more thread is used to form stitches. The needle has the ability to pierce the goods to be sewed, and contains a notch that supplies another thread to create the stitch.\\n1901- Seam for Sewed Articles\\nThis invention is a way to connect two edges of a material, specifically knit fabrics, and over edging. This method uses a series of loops made from a single thread going through the two edges of the material to create a seam.\\n1901- Hat Sewing Machine\\nThis invention is an adaptation to the sewing machine that allows it to stitch a common chain stitch with one thread to be used to sew sweatbands and strips of linen onto the inside edge of the hat. Previously, this work had been done by hand, so this machine increased the rate of production by simplifying the work needed to be done.\\n1914- Method of Selvage-Sewing\\nThis invention is a method for primarily bringing together the edges of selvage knit goods, but can also be used with other fabric for decorative uses. This method helps smooth out curls in fabric and helps create a flat seam that was not previously possible.\\n\\nSee also\\nMargaret E.

Brimming with ideas, she broke ground using her publishing, sex store, and other endeavors to promote a sex-positive feminism. Her papers are part of the Human Sexuality Collection at Cornell University Library.\\n\\nCareer\\nShe founded Down There Press, a publisher of sex-related books, in 1975. In 1977, she opened Good Vibrations, the second feminist sex toy business in the United States (the first having been Eve\\'s Garden in New York City, which was founded by Dell Williams in 1974). Prior to her opening Good Vibrations, she was hired at the University of California, San Francisco to screen candidates who had difficulties achieving orgasm. This study influenced her business model for Good Vibrations. Lynn Comella wrote that Blank turned \"her small vibrator shop into a sexual resource center for anyone who might wander in. She felt that talking about sex should be as casual as talking about the weather; she also believed that sexual information was a birthright and that no one should be made to feel ashamed or embarrassed for wanting more pleasure in their life.\"\\nShe collaborated with photographer Honey Lee Cottrell on I Am My Lover, and Down There Press published it in 1978. In this book, she paired Cottrell’s photographs of individual women with the subject’s written reflections on masturbation and on learning to give themselves pleasure. It joined Our Bodies, Ourselves (1971) and Betty Dodson\\'s Liberating Masturbation: A Meditation on Self Love (1974) as second wave feminist books aiming to educate women about their bodies and empower them to have a positive sexual life.\\nShe was one of the first volunteers at San Francisco Sex Information and has served on the Board of Directors of the Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality.

She was the first woman to be awarded a Ph.D. in physics from the University of Cambridge, in 1926.\\n\\nBirth and childhood\\nBlodgett was born on January 10, 1898 in Schenectady, New York. She was the second child of Katharine Buchanan (Burr) and George Bedington Blodgett. Her father was a patent attorney at General Electric where he headed that department. He was shot and killed in his home by a burglar just before she was born. GE offered a $5,000 reward for the arrest and conviction of the killer, but the suspected killer hanged himself in his jail cell in Salem, New York. Her mother was financially secure after her husband\\'s death, and she moved to New York City with Katharine and her son George Jr. shortly after Katharine\\'s birth.\\nIn 1901, Katherine\\'s mother moved the family to France so that the children would be bilingual. They lived there for several years, returned to New York for a year, during which time Katherine attended school in Saranac Lake, then spent time traveling through Germany. In 1912, Blodgett returned to New York City with her family and attended New York City\\'s Rayson School.\\n\\nEducation\\nBlodgett\\'s early childhood was split between New York and Europe, and she wasn\\'t enrolled in school until she was eight years old. After attending Rayson School in New York City, she entered Bryn Mawr College on a scholarship, where she was inspired by two professors in particular: mathematician Charlotte Angas Scott and physicist James Barnes.\\nIn 1917, Irving Langmuir, a former colleague of her father and future Nobel Prize laureate, took Katherine on a tour of General Electric (GE)\\'s research laboratories. He offered her a research position at GE if she first completed higher education, so she enrolled in a master\\'s degree program at the University of Chicago after receiving her bachelor\\'s degree.\\nAt the University of Chicago she studied gas adsorption with Harvey B. Lemon, researching the chemical structure of gas masks. She graduated in 1918 and took a research scientist position working with Langmuir. After six years at the company, Blodgett decided to pursue a doctoral degree with hopes of advancing further within GE. Langmuir arranged for her to study physics at Cambridge\\'s Cavendish University, persuading somewhat reluctant Cavendish administrators to offer one of their few positions to a woman. She studied with Sir Ernest Rutherford and in 1926 became the first woman to receive a PhD in physics from Cambridge University.\\n\\nWork at General Electric\\nBlodgett was hired by General Electric as a research scientist in 1918 after receiving a master\\'s degree from the University of Chicago. She was the first woman to work as a scientist for General Electric Laboratory in Schenectady, NY. She often worked with Irving Langmuir, who had pioneered a technique for creating single-molecule thin films on the surface of water. Blodgett and Langmuir explored the application of similar techniques to lipids, polymers, and proteins, creating monomolecular coatings designed to cover surfaces of water, metal, or glass. These special coatings were oily and could be deposited in layers only a few nanometers thick.\\nIn 1935, Blodgett extended Langmuir\\'s work by devising a method to spread monomolecular coatings one at a time onto glass or metal. By repeatedly dipping a metal plate into water covered by a layer of oil, she was able to stack oil layers onto the plate with molecular precision. The apparatus which she used and refined is known as the Langmuir–Blodgett trough.\\nUsing this technique, Blodgett developed practical uses for Langmuir’s gossamer films. Blodgett used a barium stearate film to cover glass with 44 monomolecular layers, making the glass more than 99% transmissive and creating \"invisible\" glass. The visible light reflected by the layers of film canceled the reflections created by the glass. This type of nonreflective coating is now called Langmuir–Blodgett film and is widely used. The first major cinematic production to use Blodgett\\'s invisible glass was the popular film Gone with the Wind (1939), noted for its crystal-clear cinematography. Once introduced, nonreflective lenses were used for projectors and cameras by the post-war movie industry. Blodgett\\'s glass was also used for submarine periscopes and airplane spy cameras during World War II.\\nBlodgett also invented the color gauge, a method to measure the molecular coatings on the glass to one millionth of an inch. The gauge employs the concept that different thicknesses of coatings are different colors. While examining the layering of stearic acid on a glass plate, she realized that the addition of each layer, about 2/10,000,000 inch thick, reliably changed the color of the plate. Before her invention, the best measurement instruments were only accurate to a few thousandths of an inch. Her glass \"ruler\" much more precisely showed the progression of colors and their corresponding thicknesses. Measuring thickness became as simple as matching colors.\\nBlodgett and Langmuir also worked on improvements to the light bulb. Their studies on electrical discharges in gases helped lay the foundations for plasma physics.\\nDr. Blodgett was issued eight U.S. patents during her career. She was the sole inventor on all but two of the patents, working with Vincent J. Schaefer as co-inventor. Blodgett published over 30 technical papers in various scientific journals and was the inventor of poison gas adsorbents, methods for deicing aircraft wings, and improving smokescreens.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nBlodgett never married and lived a vibrant life, living in a Boston marriage for many years with Gertrude Brown, who came from an old Schenectady family. For another period she also lived with Elsie Errington, the English-born director of a nearby girls\\' school. \"The household arrangement freed Blodgett from most domestic responsibilities—except for making her famous applesauce and popovers.\" Unfortunately, she did not leave any personal papers with her thoughts about her long-term relationships with these women.\\nBlodgett\\'s niece and namesake was astrophysicist and civil servant Katharine Blodgett Gebbie. In an autobiographical memoir, Gebbie recalled that on family visits her Aunt Blodgett:\\n\"always arrived with suitcases full of \\'apparatus\\', with which she showed us such wonders as how to make colors by dipping glass rods into thin films of oil floating on water.\"\\nGebbie often spoke in later life of her aunt\\'s influence by personal example on her choice of a career in science.\\nOne of her relatives is bliss blodget-Stephan and bliss blodget-Stephan’s daughter Zoe.\\n\\nSocial life and hobbies\\nBlodgett bought a home in Schenectady overlooking her birthplace where she spent most of her adult life. She was an actress in her town\\'s theater group and volunteered for civic and charitable organizations. Blodgett was the treasurer of the Traveler\\'s Aid Society there. She spent summers at a camp at Lake George in upstate New York, to pursue her love of gardening. Blodgett was also an avid amateur astronomer; she collected antiques, played bridge with friends  and wrote funny poems in her spare time. She died in her home on October 12, 1979.\\n\\nAwards\\nBlodgett received numerous awards during her lifetime. She received a star in the seventh edition of American Men of Science (1943), recognizing her as one of the 1,000 most distinguished scientists in the United States. In 1945, the American Association of University Women honored her with its Annual Achievement Award.\\nIn 1951 she received the prestigious Francis Garvan Medal from the American Chemical Society for her work on monomolecular films. That same year, she was chosen by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce as one of 15 \"women of achievement.” Also in 1951, she was honored in Boston\\'s First Assembly of American Women in Achievement (the only scientist in the group) and the mayor of Schenectady honored her with Katharine Blodgett Day on June 13, 1951 because of all the honor she had brought to her community.\\nIn 1972, the Photographic Society of America presented her with its Annual Achievement Award and in 2007 she was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In 2008 an elementary school in Schenectady was opened bearing her name.\\nShe received honorary doctorates from Elmira College (1939), Western College (1942), Brown University (1942), and Russell Sage College (1944).\\n\\nPatents\\nSee also\\nNotable American Women by the Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University\\n\\nReferences\\nFurther reading\\nShearer, Benjamin F.; Shearer, Barbara Smith (1997).

A native of Virginia, Blount was born in the Hickory, Virginia community, in Princess Anne County (now known as the city of Chesapeake).\\n\\nEducation\\nBlount attended Diggs Chapel Elementary School in Hickory, Virginia, an educational facility built after the Civil War for the opportunity of educational advancement for African American children. While attending Diggs Chapel, Blount\\'s teacher reprimanded her for writing with her left hand by rapping her knuckles, a form of discipline used at the time to teach students proper writing etiquette. Blount took this moment to her advantage, as a challenge to be ambidextrous, among other remarkable skills. Even though her right hand was her primary hand to write with, she still maintained her skill to write with her left hand as well. In addition, she taught herself the skill to be able to write without the use of her hands by holding a pencil with her teeth and feet . After the sixth grade, all of the academic resources that were being offered to African American children in her location, had been depleted, forcing Blount to stop her education. The family then relocated north to New Jersey, where Blount remained self-taught and obtained her GED. She then attended Community Kennedy Memorial Hospital\\'s nurse\\'s program, in Newark, New Jersey. . After obtaining her Nursing degree, she continued her education at Panzer College of Physical Education and Hygiene in East Orange, New Jersey and became a physical therapist.\\n\\nPhysical Therapist Career\\nDuring her career as a physical therapist, after World War II , many soldiers returned as amputees after being wounded in combat. As a part of Blount\\'s physical therapy exercises, she taught veterans who lost the ability to use their hands new ways to perform everyday tasks by substituting the use of their hands for completing task, to the use their teeth and feet. As she worked each day, Blount observed that one of the biggest challenges for patients in this condition was the task of eating without assistance from other people. It was dire to many that they regain the ability to feed themselves. Gaining this ability would give them their sense of independence back and increase their self esteem.\\n\\nInventions - Assistive Devices\\nWhile working at the Bronx Hospital in New York, Blount invented an electric self-feeding apparatus to help amputees feed themselves. Blount came up with a device that consisted of a tube that transported individual bites of food to the patient\\'s mouth. All the patient would need to do is bite down on the tube and then the food would dispense to the mouthpiece with an attached machine that would dispense the next portion of food to the patients\\' mouth when prompted. The American Veterans Administration declined Blount\\'s invention, therefore, she sold it to the French government instead. She stated that this accomplishment showed \"that a black woman can invent something for the benefit of humankind\"  Her next invention was a way for an injured/ill patient to hold something close to their face using a \"portable receptacle support.\" The device hung around a person\\'s neck with an attachment that supported a cup or a bowl. In April 1951,Blount was granted Patent No. 2,550,554 in April of 1951. During her career, Blount was a physical therapist to Thomas Edison\\'s son, Theodore Edison\\'s mother-in-law. Blount and Edison became close friends. During the time she spent in the Edison\\'s home she invented emesis basin. The basin was a disposable cardboard model made out of flour, water, and a newspaper that was baked until the material was hard. Once Again, the U.S. showed no interest in Blount\\'s invention. Nonetheless, she sold the rights to her invention to a company in Belgium, a design is still being implemented in Belgian Hospitals.\\n\\nForensic Science Career\\nIn 1969, Blount began a second career in law enforcement. Blount began conveying forensic science research for police departments in New Jersey and Virginia. As she worked with previous patients, demonstrating how to be ambidextrous, write with their teeth, or write with their feet, she began to observe the close comparison between physical health and handwriting characteristics. From her point of view, she saw how a person\\'s handwriting reflected upon their state of health. This discovery inspired her to publish a technical paper on \"medical graphology.\" After the publication of her technical paper, Blount\\'s career in forensics took quickly expanded. In the late 1960s she was assisting police departments in Norfolk, VA, Vineland, New Jersey, and later, and then to join the Portsmouth, Virginia police department as a chief examiner later in her career. In 1977,the Metropolitan Police Forensic Science Laboratory to invited Blount to join them in London for advanced studies in graphology. Later, Blount started her own business, using her forensic experience to examine documents and slave papers from the pre-civil war. Blount operated this business until the age of 83.\\n\\nInterviews and public appearances\\nBlount made numerous attempts to spark the interest of the American Veteran\\'s Association in her inventions, however, they were reluctant, despite the devices\\' evident beneficial impact that they could have on people\\'s lives. She appeared on the WCAU Philadelphia television show The Big Idea. Blount was the first African-American woman to make an appearance on the show where she demonstrated her ideas. Instead, she donated rights to both her inventions to her supporters of the French government. On the program, she stated, \"A Black woman can invent something for the benefit of human kind.\"\\n\\nHonors and awards\\nVirginia Women in History in 2005.\\n\\nDeath\\nBlount died at the age of 95 on December 30, 2009, at her home in Newfield, New Jersey.'), (1031, 'Marie-Anne Victoire Gillain Boivin (9 April 1773 – 16 May 1841) was a French midwife, inventor, and obstetrics writer. Mme Boivin has been called one of the most important women in medicine in the 19th century. Boivin invented a new pelvimeter and a vaginal speculum, and the medical textbooks that she wrote were translated to different languages and used for 150 years.\\n\\nBackground\\nMarie Anne Victoire Gillain was born in 1773 at Versailles. She was educated by nursing nuns at a nunnery in Étampes, where her talents attracted the attention of Madame Élisabeth, sister of King Louis XVI. When the nunnery was destroyed during the French Revolution, she spent three years studying anatomy and midwifery.\\nHer medical studies was interrupted when she married a government bureaucrat, Louis Boivin, in 1797. Louis Boivin died shortly thereafter, leaving her with a daughter and little money. She became a midwife at a local hospital, and in 1801 became its superintendent. In that role she convinced Jean-Antoine Chaptal to add a special school of obstetrics. Mme Boivin continues to study in the medical field. Mme Boivin then became Marie-Louise Lachapelle\\'s student, assistant, and friends in Paris. Mme Boivin received her diploma in 1800, and stayed at Versailles to practice.\\n\\nCareer\\nWhen her husband died, she returned to Paris to assist Mme Lachapelle at La Maternite. During that time, Mme Boivin developed a close relationship with Dr. Chaussier. Because of professional jealousy of her colleague and friend Mme Lachapelle, Mme Boivin resigned her position in 1811, and she rejected the offer of Mme Lachapelle\\'s position after the latter died in 1822. She accepted a position for servants\\' wages at a Paris hospital for fallen women. In the subsequent years she served as co-director or director at a number of hospitals, including the General Hospital for Seine-et-Oise (1814), a temporary military hospital (1815), the Hospice de la Maternité, and the Maison Royale de Santé. She was also member of several medical societies. She has published articles and books about her own case and her uterine speculum. Her Mémorial de l\\'art des accouchements (1817) went through several editions and became a standard textbook.\\n\\nContribution\\nMme Boivin invented a new pelvimeter, and a vaginal speculum which was used to dilate the vagina and the examination of the cervix. Her invention helped not only her female patients, but also medical practitioners. She is one of the first to use stethoscope to listen to the fetal heart. She was given credit for discovering the cause of certain types of bleeding, the cause of miscarriages and diseases of the placenta and uterus. Radcliffe stated that she \\'was undertaking surgical treatments which in other countries were the prerogative of the men.\\' Mme Boivin was also one of the first surgeons to amputate the cervix uteri for a cancerous growth. Because Mme Boivin was an innovative and skillful gynecological surgeon, German universities became more opened to the idea of women becoming skilled in gynecological surgery.\\nFrom 1812 to 1823, Mme Boivin had many publications, both original and translations. Her first edition of Memorial de l\\'Art des Accouchemens was published in 1812. It included notes she had taken from Marie-Louise Lachapelle\\'s teaching, and the book was used as a handbook for medical students and midwives. The third edition of Memorial de l\\'Art des Accouchemens was translated into several European languages. Her work of the causes of abortion received a commendation from the Royal Society of Medicine at Bordeaux.

She wrote Flight: A Quantum Fiction Novel. As an actress, Bonta played \"Zed\\'s Queen\" in The Beastmaster. She performed primarily as a voice talent on a roster of feature films, such as Disney\\'s Beauty and the Beast, as well as on television. Bonta invented the 2suit, a flight garment designed to facilitate human intimacy and stability in microgravity environments of outerspace. The spacesuit was featured on The Universe television series, which followed Bonta into zero gravity to film an episode titled Sex in Space that aired in 2009 on the History Channel.\\nOn 13 November 2013, a haiku by Bonta was one of 1,100 haiku launched from Cape Canaveral on the NASA spacecraft MAVEN to Mars.\\n\\nEarly life and family\\nBonta was born in the United States to Maria Luisa Bonta (née Ugolini), an artist from Florence, Italy, and James Cecil Bonta, a military officer from Kentucky. Her mother\\'s elder sister was Italian children\\'s author Lydia Ugolini.\\n\\nLiterary career\\nIn 1995, Bonta\\'s first novel, Flight: A Quantum Fiction Novel was published. Flight has been characterized as \"inter-genre\" (belonging to more than one genre simultaneously) by the American Library Association, which reviewed it an \"auspicious, genre-bending parable\". Publishers Weekly described the debut work as running the gamut of particularly moving to quirky and hilarious satire, with \"asides about bathtub books, self-doubt tapes and other foibles.\"\\nIn 2013, a haiku Bonta wrote was one of over 1100 that was launched to Mars on the NASA spacecraft MAVEN. The haikus for the Mars trip were chosen by popular vote from a total 12,530 submissions. Bonta\\'s submission was ranked in the top five.\\n\\nInventions\\nThe 2suit\\nIn 2006, Bonta gave talks about an invention she called the 2suit, a flight garment that can be attached to another 2suit to allow two or more people to stay in proximity to one another in low-gravity environments. Although it had several other potential applications, its primary purpose was to enable sex in space. Producers of the History Channel television series The Universe approached Bonta in 2008, offering to manufacture a prototype of the 2suit and send Bonta into zero gravity to test it. She accepted. On the 2suit\\'s segment of the episode, Bonta and her husband demonstrated how the suit works by kissing while installed in it. The documentary concluded that the \"2Suit is one small step for humankind colonizing the universe.\" The 2suit received significant media attention after the episode, titled Sex in Space, aired in 2009.\\n\\nLunar Lander Challenge\\nFrom 2007-09, she participated in the annual Lunar Lander Challenge, a competition sponsored by NASA and Northrop Grumman to commercially build a lightweight spacecraft for landing on the moon. Bonta was a team member of BonNovA. As creative director, Bonta designed a pressure-release device for high-combustion engines.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nVanna Bonta on IMDb\\nRecording of lecture in Italian by Prof. Gabriella Fiori about Flight: a quantum fiction novel, 1996'), (1033, \"Sarah Boone (1832–1904) was an African American inventor who on April 26, 1892, obtained United States patent rights for her improvements to the ironing board. Boone's ironing board was designed to improve the quality of ironing sleeves and the bodies of women's garments. The board was very narrow, curved, and made of wood. The shape and structure allowed it to fit a sleeve and it was reversible, so one could iron both sides of the sleeve. Along with Miriam Benjamin, Ellen Eglin, and Sarah Goode, Boone was one of four African American women inventors of her time who developed new technology for the home.\\n\\nBiography\\nSarah Marshall was born in Craven County, North Carolina, near the town of New Bern in February 1832.

A system she invented for building furniture out of packing crates also represents one of the earliest to adopt a modular approach to the design of individual units.\\n\\nEarly life\\nLouise Ashton Brigham was born in Boston, the fourth of five children of William Cleveland Brigham (b. 1840) and Maria Wilson Sheppard Brigham (b. 1845). She had an older brother, Waldo (b. 1869), and an older sister, Lucy (b. 1873). Another sister, Emma, was born four years before Louise but died in infancy. The final child of the family, Anna, was born a year after Louise.\\nWhen Louise was only two years old, her mother died, and she was to lose her father when she was just 19.\\nInformation about Brigham’s youth and the circumstances of her upbringing is scanty. Her father was an apothecary; the 1880 census shows the family living in Medford, Massachusetts. Given that Brigham seems never to have had to work for a living and that for much of her adult life she was not supported by a husband (she did not marry until the age of 41), it seems reasonable to deduce that her family was relatively well-off for the time.\\nBrigham studied art and design in New York at the Pratt Institute and the Chase School of Art (which became the New York School of Art in 1898 and is known today as Parsons The New School for Design), as well as at art schools in Europe.\\nAt some point in the late 1890s, Brigham became involved in the settlement house movement and established Sunshine Cottage in Cleveland, Ohio. The 1900 census lists her as a teacher and \"settlement worker\" in Cleveland.\\n\\nTravels abroad\\nDuring her early 30s, Brigham traveled widely in Europe, staying abroad for much of the period between 1905 and 1910. As she herself put it in a 1913 interview: \"I spent the biggest part of five years in Europe, studying various kinds of handiwork with the peasants and the artists of nineteen different countries.\" Her destinations included the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, and Sweden.\\nHighly influential for Brigham\\'s later design work were two summers spent in a coal-mining camp on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen, which sits well above the Arctic Circle in the Svalbard archipelago. Brigham does not precisely date these two summers in her published writings, but a reference to a visit by members of an expedition led by the American aviator Walter Wellman suggests that one of them was 1906, the year that Wellman set up headquarters in the Svalbard archipelago in an attempt to reach the North Pole by airship. Brigham stayed in a camp managed by John Munroe Longyear, a fellow Bostonian of her father’s generation. In 1905, Longyear had cofounded the Arctic Coal Company to carry out mining operations in an area along the west coast of Spitsbergen that came to be called Longyear City (today Longyearbyen). The camp housed 80 men at the time Brigham was there—rising to several hundred in the years leading up to World War I—and conditions were extremely primitive. Enough food and equipment had to be brought in by ship during the summer months to supply the camp during the eight months it would be cut off from the outside world by winter ice, and the result of this stockpiling was large stacks of empty boxes. Under these difficult conditions, Brigham undertook to design what she called \"box furniture\" for the camp out of those cast-off packing crates, following up on some earlier experiments along the same lines.\\n\\nBox furniture\\nIn 1909, Brigham published a book of her designs for building furniture entirely out of packing crates entitled Box Furniture. Illustrated with simple line drawings by the interior designer Edward H. Aschermann (whom Brigham had met through their mutual friend, the Viennese Secessionist architect-designer Josef Hoffmann), Box Furniture was a how-to manual for a target audience of modestly skilled working-class householders. It offered dozens of different furniture plans, advice on how to select and break down crates, instruction in basic carpentry, and a list of necessary tools. Designs were grouped into suites for specific rooms, as well as organized along a trajectory of increasing complexity. Brigham also offered complementary advice on curtain materials and overall color schemes.\\n\\nIn addition to working exclusively with recycled materials of the cheapest kind, Brigham planned many of her designs to be space-saving (a drop-leaf table, a set of nesting stools) as they were aimed primarily at urban apartment dwellers. Brigham also took a modular or sectional approach to some of her pieces, as several of the smaller pieces are designed in such a way that they can either stand alone or work as subunits of larger pieces.\\n\\nBrigham specifically aligns her modernist aesthetic with that of Hoffmann, with its focus on the square as a fundamental unit of design. However, the raw surfaces and rough construction that were keystones of her approach don\\'t become a mainstay of modern design for another two decades, when Gerrit Rietveld\\'s crate furniture of the 1930s recapitulates Brigham\\'s box furniture under the banner of De Stijl.\\n\\nBrigham\\'s ambitious project of combining up-to-date design with a do-it-yourself approach was both unusual in its own time and a forerunner of today\\'s green design movement. One writer assesses Brigham\\'s project as \"a comprehensive system attached to a design theory and a social agenda\".\\n\\nHome Thrift Association\\nIn 1910, Brigham showed \"Room Delightful\", an entire suite of box furniture for a child’s room at a Child Welfare Exhibit in New York City. Interested city officials offered Brigham the use of the then-closed Gracie Mansion for further experimentation. Brigham accepted and founded the Home Thrift Association, a woodworking \"laboratory\" for boys: \"We give each boy a set of the seven simple tools and show him the beginnings of his work. Then he does the rest.\" The HTA, which later opened to girls as well, aimed \"not only at thrift, but at the conservation of the home.\"\\nInitially headquartered in just two rooms of Gracie Mansion, the club quickly outgrew its space as it gained some 600 apprentices in its first year of operation. It then moved to 516 E. 89th Street, not far from Brigham’s own apartment at 539 E. 89th St., which Brigham furnished almost entirely out of box furniture made by the HTA apprentices as a kind of model showroom for the project. The total cost of the box furnishings for Brigham\\'s apartment was around $4, or less than half of an average worker\\'s weekly wage.\\n\\nLater years\\nIn part due to Brigham\\'s teaching at the HTA and associated publicity, box furniture had something of a vogue in the years leading up to World War I. Her book went through several editions and was translated into a number of foreign languages. However, after the war information on Brigham again becomes thin. On August 21, 1916, Brigham married 64-year-old Henry Arnott Chisholm at the Mission Inn in Riverside, California, eighteen months after the death of his first wife. A graduate of the Harvard class of 1874, Chisholm lived in Cleveland, where he had worked for the Cleveland Rolling Mills and later become a partner in William Chisholm Steel Shovel Works.\\nIn 1940, Brigham received a medal from the HTA in honor of her quarter century of service to the organization she founded. She died in the Sylvan Nursing Home in Trenton, New Jersey, on March 30, 1956.\\n\\nPublications\\nBox Furniture: How to Make a Hundred Useful Articles for the Home. Illustrations by Edward H.

During her career she was involved in a broad range of national space programs in the United States, including NASA and the International Maritime Satellite Organization.\\n\\nEarly life\\nYvonne Madelaine Claeys was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Her parents were immigrants from Belgium. She attended the University of Manitoba, but was barred from studying engineering because of her gender, so she studied chemistry and mathematics.\\n\\nCareer\\nBrill\\'s work in satellite propulsion systems resulted in a number of significant developments. She developed the concept for a new rocket engine, the hydrazine resistojet, and she proposed the use of a single propellant because of the value and simplicity that it would provide. Her invention resulted in not only higher engine performance but also increased reliability of the propulsion system. Due to the reduction this created in propellant weight requirements this resulted in either increased payload capability or extended mission life.\\nAs a result of her innovative concepts for satellite propulsion systems and her breakthrough engineering solutions, Brill earned an international reputation as a pioneer in space exploration and utilization. Brill invented the hydrazine resistojet propulsion system in 1967 for which she holds U.S. Patent No. 3,807,657. Her invention became a standard in the industry, and has translated into millions of dollars of increased revenue for commercial communications satellite owners.\\nBrill contributed to the propulsion systems of TIROS, the first weather satellite; Nova, a series of rocket designs that were used in American moon missions; Explorer 32, the first upper-atmosphere satellite; and the Mars Observer, which in 1992 almost entered a Mars orbit before losing communication with Earth.\\n\\nAwards and honors\\nBrill was awarded the AIAA Wyld Propulsion Award (2002) and the American Association of Engineering Societies John Fritz Medal (2009). In 1980, Harper\\'s Bazaar and the DeBeers Corporation gave her their Diamond Superwoman award for returning to a successful career after starting a family. In 2001 she was awarded the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal. In 2011 President Barack Obama presented her with the National Medal of Technology and Innovation.\\nShe was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1987. She received the Achievement Award, the highest honor of The Society of Women Engineers (SWE), in 1986 and was named a SWE Fellow in 1985.\\nThe Yvonne C. Brill Lectureship of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) is named in her honor and presented annually.\\n\\nDeath\\nA longtime resident of the Skillman section of Montgomery Township, New Jersey, Brill died of complications of breast cancer in Princeton, New Jersey.\\nAn obituary of Brill published in the March 30, 2013 issue of the New York Times originally began: \"She made a mean beef stroganoff, followed her husband from job to job and took eight years off from work to raise three children\". The obituary was heavily criticized for leading with and overemphasizing Brill\\'s gender and family life, rather than her scientific and career accomplishments and was cited as an example of an article that failed the Finkbeiner test.

Brown was born in Jamaica, Queens, New York; she died there at the age of 76.\\n\\nBiography\\nMarie Van Brittan Brown's father was born in Massachusetts and her mother's roots originated from Pennsylvania. Marie and her husband lived at 151-158 & 135th Avenue in Jamaica Queens, NY. She worked as a nurse and her husband was an electronics technician, so they did not always normal hours or simultaneously work. Marie and Alberta Brown had two children. Their daughter Norma followed in her mother's footsteps and became a nurse as well as creator of her own inventions.\\n\\nInvention\\nBrown cited the inspiration for her invention as the long time it would take for police to arrive at a house after being called by residents. Marie did not always feel safe when she was home alone at times, because the crime rate had risen in her neighborhood. Having to answer the door to know who was on the other side was not something Marie liked to do. Brown's system had a set of four peep-holes and a camera that could slide up and down to look at each one. Anything and everything the camera picked up would appear on a monitor. Also, a resident could unlatch the door by remote control.The system included a device that enabled a homeowner to use a television set to view the person at the door and hear the caller's voice. The home security system that she and her husband invented allowed monitor to be in a different room, and all of this was possible via a radio controlled wireless system. If the person viewing the images on the monitor did not feel safe they could press a button that would send an alarm to police or security. She and her husband cited other inventors in their patent, such as Edward D. Phiney and Thomas J. Reardon. Thirteen inventors who came along after Marie have cited her patent, with the latest being in 2013. Even now, over fifty years later, her invention is being used by smaller businesses and living facilities.\\nAlthough the system was originally intended for domestic uses, many businesses began to adopt her system due to its effectiveness.

Brown received her B.A. from Mount Holyoke College and her Ph.D from the University of Chicago. She was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1994.\\nNystatin, still produced today under various trade names, not only cures a variety of potentially devastating fungal infections, but has also been used to combat Dutch Elm disease in trees and to restore artwork damaged by water and mold.\\n\\nEarly life\\nRachel Fuller Brown was born on November 23, 1898 in Springfield, Massachusetts to parents George Hamilton Brown, a real estate and insurance agent, and Annie Fuller, a director of religious education. They later moved to Missouri where, at the age of fourteen, Brown’s parents separated and her father left the family with almost no money. So her family of three moved back to Springfield.\\n\\nEducation\\nUpon the family’s return to Springfield, Rachel enrolled in Commercial High School, but her mother forced her to transfer to Central High School for a more traditional education.\\nBrown’s hard work and determination to go to college impressed Henriette F. Dexter, a friend of her grandmother, who decided to pay for Brown to attend Mount Holyoke College. Though she originally chose to major in history, she fell in love with chemistry, a strong field at Mount Holyoke, after taking a required science course taught by Emma P. Carr. Brown earned her B.A. in chemistry and history in 1920.\\nAfter working as a laboratory assistant for some time, Brown eventually began her graduate work and earned an M.S. in organic chemistry from the University of Chicago in 1921. She then taught for three years at the Frances Shimer School near Chicago, a school and junior college for girls (now known as Shimer College).\\nAfter taking some language courses and chemistry at Harvard, Brown returned to the University of Chicago for additional graduate work in organic chemistry and bacteriology. After successfully completing her research project and the required course work in 1926, she submitted her Ph.D thesis. However, due to some complications in scheduling her oral examinations and the depletion of her savings, Brown was forced to leave Chicago without her Ph.D to find a job at the Division of Laboratories and Research in Albany, New York.\\n\\nEarly career\\nThe Division of Labororatories and Research, a major arm of the New York Department of Health, was famous for its research of human disease-causing agents and the creation of antiserums and vaccines. There Brown worked for seven years without her Ph.D until her return to Chicago for a scientific meeting, at which point Brown arranged to take her oral examinations and was awarded her Ph.D.\\nAt the division’s laboratory, Brown focused on identifying the types of bacteria that caused pneumonia, helping develop a pneumonia vaccine still in use today. Additionally, she researched ways to improve the test for syphilis.\\n\\nDiscovering fungal antibiotic\\nHowever, the antibacterial and antifungal work that she is best known for did not begin until 1948. During this year, Brown embarked on a project with Elizabeth Lee Hazen, a leading authority on fungus and bacteria related research. The project would eventually bring the two scientists national recognition for discovering an antibiotic to fight fungal infections.\\nPenicillin had been discovered in 1928, and in the years that followed, antibiotics were increasingly used to fight bacterial illness. However, one side effect was that these antibiotics allowed for a rapid growth of fungus, which could lead to sore mouths or upset stomachs. Other fungal diseases without cures including infections attacking the central nervous system, athlete’s foot, and ring worms were also a major problem during this time. However, fungal diseases were not well understood at this time, and there were no antifungal medications safe for human use. At this time, people knew of microorganisms called actinomycetes that lived in soil and were known to produce antibiotics, some of which killed fungus. However, these antibiotics also proved fatal in tests involving lab mice and thus could not be put into production.\\nThe successful partnership between Hazen in New York City and Brown in Albany was due in part to the efficiency of the United States Postal Service in the 1940s. In her New York City laboratory, Hazen cultured organisms found in soil samples and tested their ability to fight against two fungi: Cryptococcus neoformans, a fungus responsible for the chronic disease cryptococcosis, which affects lungs, skin, and other body parts like the central nervous system, and Candida albicans, which causes candidiasis, which can be minor in some cases (e.g. a vaginal yeast infection), or a serious infection in patients treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. If she found such promising antifungal activity in a particular culture, she would mail it to Brown in a mason jar.\\nAt her end, Brown isolated the active agent in the culture, or the ingredient in the soil sample that could potentially be used to cure these fungal diseases. This was before the days of high-performance liquid chromatography and other separation techniques and required meticulous labor as well as a great deal of patience and paintstaking attention to detail. After isolating the active ingredient, Brown would return the sample to Hazen in New York, where it was retested against the two fungi. If effective, the toxicity was then evaluated in animals.\\nNearly all the agents that killed the test fungi also turned out to be highly toxic to animals, signifying that they could not be safely used for human treatment. Interestingly enough, of the hundreds of soil samples sent to Hazen and Brown from around the world, the one culture that was effective against fungi and not fatal to animals was originally found in the soil near a barn of two of Hazen’s friends, the Walter B. Nourses. The microorganism discovered in the soil was later named Streptomyces noursei in their honor. Brown’s chemical testing showed that the microorganism in this particular soil sample produced two antifungal substances called Fractions N and AN. Fraction N was fatal on tests with animals, just like the other substances that Hazen tested. However, Fraction AN proved safe in tests on live animals and was effective not only against the initial two fungi, but fourteen others as well. Brown then purified this second antibiotic into small white crystals. The two scientists first named the drug fungicidin, but upon discovery that the name was already in use, changed it to “Nystatin” in honor of the New York State Division of Laboratories and Research.\\n\\nNystatin\\nNystatin is a polyene antifungal drug to which many molds and yeast infections are sensitive. It was also the first antifungal antibiotic to be safe and effective in treating human diseases. Not only did it cure many serious fungal infections of the skin, mouth, throat, and intestinal tract, but it could also be combined with antibacterial drugs to balance their side effects. Over the years, Nystatin proved effective not only in fighting human diseases, but was also used to stop fungal growth on flood-damaged works of art in Florence, Italy. It also showed effectiveness in slowing the spread of Dutch Elm Disease, a fungal disease of elm trees spread by the elm bark beetle.\\n\\nAnnouncement and production\\nBrown and Hazen presented their work at the National Academy of Sciences regional meeting in 1950. The subsequent report by the New York Times started a flurry of calls from pharmaceutical companies, interested in the commercial possibilities of nystatin. The pharmaceutical industry had the manufacturing capabilities and ability to test the compound on humans. However, to license the substance, control the purity, and protect the financial interests of the developers, Gilbert Dalldorf, the division director of the laboratory in which Hazen and Brown worked, assigned patent royalties to the Research Corporation of New York, a nonprofit foundation created for the advancement of science. The production license was awarded to E. R. Squibb & Sons, who developed a safe method of mass production and produced the first sale of the tablets, named mycostatin, for human use in 1954.\\n\\nLater years\\nIn 1951, the Department of Health and Laboratories promoted Brown to associate biochemist. Brown and Hazen, in continuing their research, discovered two additional antibiotics—phalmycin and capacidin. The two continued to work closely together in making additional minor contributions to the field of bacteriology until their retirement.\\nBrown died on January 14, 1980 at the age of 81 in Albany, New York.\\n\\nAwards and recognition\\nRoyalties for nystatin totaled $13.4 million. As Brown and Hazen did not want any of the money for themselves, the philanthropic Research Corporation used half for grants to further scientific research and the other half to support what became known as the Brown-Hazen Fund.\\nBoth Brown and Hazen received many awards for their collaborative work, the first major prize being the Squibb Award in Chemotherapy in 1955. Brown was also elected fellow of the New York Academy of Sciences in 1957. On Brown’s retirement in 1968, she received the Distinguished Service Award of the New York Department of Health. In 1972, she was also given the Rhoda Benham Award of the Medical Mycological Society of the Americas. Brown and Hazen were the first women ever to receive, in 1975, the American Institute of Chemists’ Chemical Pioneer Award.\\nBrown was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1994.\\n\\nPhilanthropy\\nBrown was a member of St. Peter’s Episcopal Church since she first arrived in Albany. There she met Dorothy Wakerley, a woman who became her lifelong friend and companion. They shared a house, and like many other unmarried women during their time, they cared for an extended family over the years. They lived with Brown’s grandmother, mother, and various nieces as well as nephews. Brown also invited a succession of visiting women scientists from China. Brown continued her active community life in retirement, becoming the first female vestry, or administrative member, of her Episcopalian church. She also taught Sunday school for many years.\\nBetween 1957 and 1978, the Brown-Hazen Fund supported training and research in biomedical sciences and encouraged women to take up careers in science. For several years the fund was the largest single source of nonfederal funds for medical mycology in the United States.\\nFor over fifty years, Brown was also an active member of the American Association of University Women, strongly supporting the participation of women in science.\\nBy her death, Brown had not only paid back Henriette Dexter, the wealthy woman who made it possible for her to attend college, but possibly more important, the money she earned from royalties allowed her to create new funds for scientific research and scholarships to provide other scientists with the same opportunities.\\nIn a statement published in the Chemist the month of her death, Brown said she hoped for a future of “equal opportunities and accomplishments for all scientists regardless of sex.”\\n\\n\\n== References =='), (1038, 'Maria Christina Bruhn (1732– 21 October 1808) was a Swedish chemist and inventor, likely to be the first patented female inventor of her country.\\nBruhn was the eldest of three daughters of the book printer Johan Bruhn (d. 1742).

She was educated in mechanical drawing and had a specific insight into the manufacturing process for textile. She was probably born in the 1840s, though she was possibly a Scottish immigrant and thus no record of her birth in Buffalo has been found. She is known for 13 US patents that all have in common methods to save time by repetitive tasks in what is commonly known as \"woman\\'s work\". She also founded two companies, the \"Carpenter Sewing Machine Needle Co.\" and the \"Carpenter Straw Sewing Machine Co.\".\\n\\nPatents\\nHer first patent dates from 1862 for creating an ironing or \"fluting\" machine, meant to simplify the creation of fluted pleats in clothing that was fashionable at the time.\\nHer next patent dates from 1871 for \"a useful Improvement in the Feed-motion of Sewing-Machines\".\\nHer next patent dates from 1872 for \"sewing-machines which are especially designed for sewing straw-braid and consists mainly in the construction of the hooked needle employed for drawing the loop through the braid, and also in the mechanism for giving certain peculiar movements to said needle\". It is worth noting here that the first US patent filed by a woman was for a cost-improving innovation regarding making women\\'s straw hats, by Mary Dixon Kies, who died before she could profit from her patent. Her original 1809 patent was burned in a fire in 1836, so this 1872 patent is possibly the first patent regarding improvements for straw hat making after that one.\\nShe filed a patent for a coal shovel in 1885.\\nShe also filed a patent for a mosquito-net bed canopy in 1885.\\nShe was clearly still working on mosquito problems five years later when she was awarded a patent for a mosquito trap.\\nShe filed a patent for a strong and effective holder for stretching and supporting thin fabrics or material during the operation of embroidering its surface with a stitched pattern, or otherwise ornamenting the same in 1893.\\nIn 1895 she filed a patent for a device or attachment which will improve the hang of such organ-pipe or goddet skirts, causing them to hang in the desired folds and causing the material to return to the proper folds \\'after being disarranged, and by which the folds will be preserved as long as the dress is worn, and which device shall render the use of hair-cloth or similar material heretofore used in such skirts unnecessary, and shall be light, inexpensive, and comfortable and convenient.\\nHer last known patent was for a hair comb in 1904.\\n\\n\\n== References =='), (1044, 'Leona W.

She first became a nationally known figure on ABC\\'s Fridays, which was ABC\\'s attempt to create its own version of Saturday Night Live. She immediately stood out on the series, partly thanks to her regular role as the anchor on the show\\'s fake newscasts, but also due to her comedic skills (particularly an impression of Nancy Reagan). On one sketch, she was cold-cocked on live TV when co-star Maryedith Burrell failed to pull her punch during a skit and chipped a tooth.\\nBetween the demise of Fridays in 1982 and her return to a regular series in 1990 with Parker Lewis Can\\'t Lose (in which she co-starred for three seasons as the high-strung Principal Grace Musso), Chartoff continued to work steadily on television throughout the 1980s, including appearances on Mr. Belvedere, Wiseguy, and St. Elsewhere, as well as a recurring role on Newhart as Dr. Kaiser.

Chen died of Alzheimer\\'s disease in 1994; since then, her accomplishments and influence on American cuisine have been honored by the US Postal Service and the city of Cambridge.\\n\\nEarly life\\nBorn in Beijing to a high ranking family in the Republic of China under Sun Yat-sen, Chen and husband Thomas with their children Henry and Helen left Shanghai in 1949 as the Communists were taking over the country. Chen and her family ultimately settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1952, her son Stephen was born. The family was on the second-to-last boat to leave Shanghai before Mao Zedong\\'s victory in the Communist Revolution resulted in China\\'s isolation from the rest of the world.\\nIn her book, Joyce Chen Cook Book, she said that she grew up with a family chef who left to cook for her father\\'s friend, \"Uncle Li,\" who became the Chinese ambassador to Russia. At that point her mother and her governess cooked the family meals, and Joyce Chen watched, and she learned.\\n\\nRestaurants\\nIn 1958, Chen opened her first restaurant, \"Joyce Chen Restaurant\", at 617 Concord Avenue in Cambridge. According to her son Stephen, here she pioneered the all-you-can-eat Chinese dinner buffet to boost sales on otherwise slow Tuesday and Wednesday nights. She also used the buffet format to allow customers to sample unfamiliar but authentic dishes at a pace of their own choosing. She promoted healthy Chinese cooking and refused to use Red Dye No. 2 and other food coloring in her restaurants. For Chinese-speaking and English-speaking staff and customers to communicate more easily, Chen introduced the practice of numbering menu items.\\nChen introduced northern Chinese (Mandarin) and Shanghainese dishes to Boston, including Peking duck, moo shu pork, hot and sour soup, and potstickers, which she called \"Peking Ravioli\" or \"Ravs\". The first restaurant closed in 1971. Members of Bolt, Beranek and Newman\\'s IMP team, when they were working on the first IMPs to create the ARPANET in 1969, would eat Chen\\'s food at her restaurant, which was located next door to BBN.\\nJoyce Chen\\'s second restaurant, \"The Joyce Chen Small Eating Place\", was opened in 1967 at 302 Massachusetts Avenue in Central Square, located between Harvard University and MIT. Joyce Chen\\'s son, Stephen Chen, also noted that the opening of this restaurant changed the landscape of the Central Square area in Cambridge. Up until then, it was a retail and industrial area, dominated by a NECCO (New England Confectionery Company) factory. People lined up to get Chen\\'s Chinese food at this small restaurant, which seated 60 people. According to Stephen Chen, at this restaurant his mother introduced the Northern style of dim sum, and the now popular \"soup dumplings\" (shao long bao). The restaurant was very popular with computer hackers. It closed in 1988.\\nIn 1969, Chen opened her third restaurant, a much larger space seating 500 people, in an existing building located at 500 Memorial Drive in Cambridge. This restaurant benefited from its proximity to MIT and Harvard. However, this restaurant was required to close in 1974, and the building was demolished so that the MIT dorms New House, and later, Next House, could be built on the site. New House was jokingly known as the \"Joyce Chen Small Living Place\" for a time.\\nIn 1973, Joyce Chen opened her fourth restaurant in a modernist custom-designed building at 390 Rindge Avenue, near Fresh Pond. This restaurant, also called \"Joyce Chen Restaurant\", seated 263. It operated for 25 years, closing in 1998. It has since been replaced with residential housing.\\nJoyce Chen was a warm hostess who formed relationships with many guests, including John Kenneth Galbraith, James Beard, Julia Child, Henry Kissinger, Beverly Sills, and Danny Kaye. A former Harvard president called her eating establishment \"not merely a restaurant, but a cultural exchange center\".\\n\\nCareer highlights\\nFollowing the 1958 opening of her first restaurant, in 1960 Joyce Chen began teaching Chinese cooking at the Cambridge Center for Adult Education and the Boston Center for Adult Education. There were waiting lists for her classes. At this time, she introduced many Americans to home style and gourmet Chinese cooking techniques.\\nIn 1962, Joyce Chen published her influential cookbook, the Joyce Chen Cook Book. Publishers had balked at her insistence on color pictures of food, so she had the book published privately at her own expense. She pre-sold over 6,000 copies of her book at her restaurants before the book was printed. MSG was popular at the time, and was included in most of the recipes.\\nIn 1967, Chen starred in her own cooking show called Joyce Chen Cooks, on the Public Broadcasting System (PBS). Twenty-six episodes were filmed on the same set as The French Chef (featuring Julia Child) in the studios of WGBH in Boston. The show aired in the US, as well as the United Kingdom and Australia. Celebrity chef Ming Tsai later said of Chen, \"She is the Chinese Julia Child [...] Joyce Chen helped elevate what Chinese food was about. She didn\\'t dumb it down. She opened people\\'s eyes to what good Chinese could taste like.\"\\nWith a spirit of adventure, according to her son Stephen Chen, in 1968 Joyce Chen took her then 16-year-old son Stephen, and 20-year-old daughter Helen on a trip around the world on Pan Am Flight 001. Joyce, Stephen, and Helen Chen also traveled to China in 1972, the same year that President Nixon first visited China. A PBS documentary on this trip was produced. Soon after Joyce Chen\\'s China aired, she and her family were the victims of a home invasion by five intruders who had seen the film, according to her son Stephen Chen.\\nIn 1971, Joyce Chen launched a line of Chinese cooking utensils. At that time she helped popularize and held the patent to the flat bottom wok with a handle, also known as a stir fry pan, and sold polyethylene cutting boards (Sumitomo Bakelite). In 1982, Joyce Chen Specialty Foods was formed to sell bottled sauces. In 1976, according to her son, Stephen, she suffered a serious injury to her right hand when she dropped a large glass jar that contained her stir fry sauce. She underwent four to five hours of microsurgery, but never fully recovered the use of her right hand.\\n\\nLegacy\\nChen was diagnosed with Alzheimer\\'s disease in 1985  and succumbed to it in 1994 in Lexington, Massachusetts.\\nPosthumously in 1998, Chen\\'s contributions to cuisine were described in Beard House, The Magazine of the James Beard Foundation. In September 2012, the city of Cambridge held their first \"Festival of Dumplings\" in Central Square to honor Joyce Chen\\'s birthday. There have since been dumpling festivals in 2013 and 2014. The New York Historical Society exhibit, Chinese American: Exclusion/Inclusion (September 26, 2014 - April 19, 2015) reviews the history of the Chinese in America, and featured Joyce Chen\\'s contributions.\\nOn September 26, 2014, the US Postal Service issued 20 million copies of the \"Celebrity Chefs Forever\" stamp series, which featured portraits by Jason Seiler of five American chefs: Joyce Chen, Julia Child, James Beard, Edna Lewis, and Felipe Rojas-Lombardi.\\nAccording to the Postal Service, \"Joyce Chen is one of the great popularizers of Chinese food. From her landmark restaurant in the Boston area to her cookbooks and trailblazing PBS television show, Chen invited newcomers to sample unfamiliar dishes in ways that firmly established Chinese cuisine in the United States.\"\\nStephen Chen is president of Joyce Chen Foods, Inc., which sells products inspired by Joyce Chen\\'s recipes, including Asian sauces, oils, condiments, spices and frozen potstickers. Her daughter, Helen Chen, markets \"Helen\\'s Asian Kitchen\" products for Harold Import Company. Helen Chen has written three cookbooks of her own. Son Henry Chen (d. 2007) owned \"Joyce Chen Unlimited\", a retail store in Acton, Massachusetts, which closed in March 2008.\\nMany Joyce Chen disciples still own and run Boston area Chinese restaurants. Among them is Pui Chan at \"The Wok\" in Wellesley, Massachusetts. Chan worked for Chen starting in 1976 at the Alewife location. Chan opened his own restaurant with Chen\\'s encouragement in 1978.\\n\\nReferences\\nFurther reading\\nArdnt, Alice (2006).

She studied art at the Académie Colarossi in Paris and at the Art Students League of New York. On 1 July 1926, she married Fletcher Pratt, a prolific American author. They lived in New York City. She illustrated several of Pratt\\'s books, including Tales from Gavagan\\'s Bar, Empire and the Sea, The Empire and the Glory, and A Man and His Meals. She also collaborated with him on at least two stories, and served as his literary executor. \\nUnder the names of \"Inga Stephens\", \"Inga\", and later \"Inga Pratt\", she was a freelance commercial artist, specializing in fashion. She collaborated with Tedi Berri on a textbook, Fashion Drawing. Kay Hardy wrote: \"Such artists as... Inga Pratt, of Bloomingdale\\'s, have a style of work as definite as individual handwriting and no more to be imitated than the signature on a check.\"  She also collaborated in writing a couple of science fiction stories with her husband, for which she used the name I. M. Stephens.\\nShe invented an improved scarf, for which she obtained a patent in 1959.\\nOf her, Fletcher Pratt wrote: \"She is a South Dakota Norwegian, brought up in Montana, where she learned to ride a horse before she was seven, and where she had a collection of pets, which included four eagles, one coyote, one bull-snake, and fourteen cats. She eats a very light breakfast. Her fashion drawings appear in the New York papers almost daily and in various magazines. She finds bridge a waste of time but has illustrated several books. She occasionally plays a recorder, knows how to drive a car, and spends weekends in the country.\"\\nIn the early 1950s, the Pratts hosted meetings of the Hydra Club, a social group of New York science fiction writers, in their Manhattan apartment at 32 West 58th Street. Hydra Club members included Frederik Pohl, Lester del Rey, David A. Kyle, Judith Merril, Martin Greenberg, Robert W. Lowndes, Philip Klass, Willy Ley, George O. Smith, Sam Merwin, and Harry Harrison.\\nLater the Pratts purchased a sprawling home in Highlands, New Jersey, with over thirty rooms, nicknaming it the Ipsy-Wipsy Institute. It too became a gathering place for their literary friends. Their guests included the Hydra Club members already mentioned, other science fiction and fantasy writers such as L. Sprague de Camp, Theodore Sturgeon, Isaac Asimov, and Laurence Manning, and notable mainstream authors and editors such as John Ciardi, Basil Davenport, Bernard DeVoto, and Eugenie Clark.\\nAfter Fletcher Pratt\\'s death, Inga married the chemist and author John Drury Clark in 1962.

She specialized in electrical power system analysis  and wrote Circuit Analysis of A-C Power Systems.\\n\\nEarly life and education\\nEdith Clarke was born February 10, 1883, in Howard County, Maryland to John Ridgely Clarke and Susan Dorsey Owings, one of nine children. After being orphaned at age 12, she was raised by her older sister. She used her inheritance to study mathematics and astronomy at Vassar College, where she graduated in 1908.\\nAfter college, Clarke taught mathematics and physics at a private school in San Francisco and at Marshall College. She then spent some time studying civil engineering at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, but left to become a \"computer\" at AT&T in 1912. She computed for George Campbell, who applied mathematical methods to the problems of long-distance electrical transmissions. While at AT&T, she studied electrical engineering at Columbia University by night.\\nIn 1918, Clarke enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the following year she became the first woman to earn an M.S. in electrical engineering from MIT.\\n\\nProfessional career\\nUnable to find work as an engineer, she went to work for General Electric as a supervisor of computers in the Turbine Engineering Department. During this time, she invented the Clarke calculator, in 1921, a simple graphical device that solved equations involving electric current, voltage and impedance in power transmission lines. The device could solve line equations involving hyperbolic functions ten times faster than previous methods. She filed a patent for the calculator in 1921 and it was granted in 1925.\\nIn 1921, still unable to obtain a position as an engineer, she left GE to teach physics at the Constantinople Women\\'s College in Turkey. The next year, she was re-hired by GE as an electrical engineer in the Central Station Engineering Department. Clarke retired from General Electric in 1945.\\nHer background in mathematics helped her achieve fame in her field. On February 8, 1926, as the first woman to deliver a paper at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers\\' annual meeting, she showed the use of hyperbolic functions for calculating the maximum power that a line could carry without instability. Two of her later papers won awards from the AIEE: the Best Regional Paper Prize in 1932 and the Best National Paper Prize in 1941.\\nIn 1943, Edith Clarke wrote an influential textbook in the field of power engineering, Circuit Analysis of A-C Power Systems, based on her notes for lectures to GE engineers.\\nIn 1947, she joined the faculty of the Electrical Engineering Department at the University of Texas at Austin, making her the first female professor of Electrical Engineering in the country. She taught for ten years and retired in 1957.\\nIn an interview with the Daily Texan on March 14, 1948, Clarke observed: \"There is no demand for women engineers, as such, as there are for women doctors; but there\\'s always a demand for anyone who can do a good piece of work.\"\\n\\nHonors\\nEdith Clarke was the first female engineer to achieve professional standing in Tau Beta Pi. In 1948, Clarke was the first female Fellow of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. In 1954, she received the Society of Women Engineers Achievement Award.\\nIn 2015, Clarke was posthumously inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.\\n\\nFurther reading\\nLayne, Margaret E.

She was one of the first British women artists to make a major part of her living through the commercial press, selling satirical and comic illustrations to more than half a dozen periodicals.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nAdelaide Sophia Claxton was born in London, one of two gifted daughters of the British painter Marshall Claxton; both Adelaide and her sister Florence followed their father in becoming painters. However, she did not share her father\\'s taste for large oil paintings. She studied art at Cary\\'s School in the Bloomsbury area of London, where she began to focus on figure painting in watercolor.\\nIn 1850, she traveled with her family to Australia, where she remained for four years before returning to England by way of Calcutta, India.\\n\\nCareer\\nClaxton\\'s paintings combine scenes of domestic life with literary or fantasy elements like ghosts and dreams. She began exhibiting her work in the late 1850s at the Society of Women Artists, and between then and 1896 exhibited multiple times at the Royal Academy of Arts, Royal Hibernian Academy, and Royal Society of British Artists, as well as the Society of Women Artists. One of her works, A Midsummer Night\\'s Dream at Hampton Court, was so popular that she ended by painting 5 copies of it; another, Little Nell, she copied 13 times. Wonderland, a painting showing a little girl reading tales from the Brothers Grimm by candlelight, is much reproduced. The English painter Walter Sickert based his oil painting She Was the Belle of the Ball [After Adelaide Claxton] on one of her works.\\n\\nClaxton earned her living in part through her paintings and in part by selling comic illustrations and satirical drawings of high society to popular magazines like Bow Bells, The Illustrated London News, London Society, Judy (where she was one of the chief illustrators), and several others. She was one of the first British women artists to work regularly in the magazine market, where she was paid on the order of £2–7 per illustration. As early as 1859, the Illustrated Times featured her painting The Standard-Bearer on its cover. Claxton also authored two illustrated books, A Shillingsworth of Sugar-Plums (1867; puzzlingly advertised as containing \"several hundreds of Num-nums and Nicy-nicies\") and Brainy Odds and Ends (1904; a compendium of mottoes and the like).\\nClaxton\\'s work is in the collection of the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, and other arts institutions.\\n\\nPersonal life and inventions\\n\\nIn 1874, Claxton married George Gordon Turner, an event that effectually ended her career as an illustrator. The couple settled in Chiswick and had a son. Claxton turned her interest to invention, and in the 1890s several patents were registered under her married name of Adelaide Sophia Turner. One of these was for an \"Armpit-Crutch for Bed-Rests and Chair-Backs\". Another was for \"Ear-caps for outstanding ears\" (i.e., ears that stuck out).\\n\\n\\n== References =='), (1050, 'Eleanor Coade (3 June 1733 – 16 November 1821) was a British businesswoman known for manufacturing Neoclassical statues, architectural decorations and garden ornaments made of \"Lithodipyra\" (Coade stone) for over 50 years from 1769 until her death. She should not be confused or conflated with her mother, also named Eleanor.  \\nLithodipyra (\"stone fired twice\") was a high-quality, durable moulded weather-resistant, ceramic stoneware; statues and decorative features from this still look almost new today. Coade did not invent \\'artificial stone\\', as various inferior quality precursors had been both patented and manufactured over the previous forty years, but she likely perfected both the clay recipe and the firing process.\\nShe combined high-quality manufacturing and artistic taste, together with entrepreneurial, business and marketing skills, to create the overwhelmingly successful stone products of her age. She produced stoneware for St George\\'s Chapel, Windsor; The Royal Pavilion, Brighton; Carlton House, London and the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. Shortly after her death, her company produced a large quantity of stoneware used in the refurbishment of Buckingham Palace.\\nBorn in Exeter to two families of wool merchants and weavers, she ran her business, \"Coade\\'s Artificial Stone Manufactory\", \"Coade and Sealy\" and latterly \"Coade\" (by appointment to George III and the Prince Regent), for fifty years in Lambeth, London. A devout Baptist, she died unmarried in Camberwell.\\nIn 1784 an uncle, Samuel Coade, gave her Belmont House, a holiday villa in Lyme Regis, her late father\\'s town of origin. She decorated the house extensively with Coade stone.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nEarly life\\nEleanor Coade was born on 3 June 1733 in Exeter, the elder daughter of the Nonconformist (devout Baptist) family of George and Eleanor Coade. George Coade (1706–1769) was a wool merchant originally from Lyme Regis, and his wife Eleanor (Elinore, née Enchmarch) (c.1708–1796) was the daughter of Thomas and Sarah Enchmarch (d.1735) merchants and textile manufacturers of Tiverton, Devon. Eleanor\\'s younger sister Elizabeth was born 1738 in Exeter.\\nEleanor\\'s maternal grandmother Sarah Enchmarch was a successful business woman in Tiverton, running the family textile business for 25 years after her husband Thomas died in 1735. Since the Middle Ages, the town had been a centre of the woollen textile business, with thousands of workers. Mrs Enchmarch employed 200 people making cloth, and used spies to learn the latest techniques used in Norwich. She was known to travel around Tiverton in a sedan chair. In 1749, with revenues from her business, she re-built the Enchmarch mansion.\\n\\nLater life\\nAbout 1760, the Coade family moved from Exeter to London. By the mid-1760s, daughter Eleanor Coade was running her own business as a linen draper in the City of London. As was customary for unmarried women in business at the time, she used Mrs as a courtesy title.\\nIn early 1769 the family were living at St Thomas Apostles Street when her father George Coade died that year, after having gone bankrupt for the second time. From around 1769, when the daughter Eleanor Coade bought an artificial stone factory, she lived on the factory premises at Narrow Wall, Lambeth. Bills show that she was directly managing the factory by 1771 at the latest.\\nIn 1784 Eleanor Coade was given Belmont House, Lyme Regis, Dorset, by her uncle Samuel Coade. It had been built in 1774 by Simon Bunter, an attorney at law from Axminster. It was a simple two-storey Georgian seaside villa known as Bunter\\'s Castle but renamed Belmont House by the Coade family. Author John Fowles lived there from 1968-2005 and it is now owned by the Landmark Trust.\\nBy 1811 Coade was living in Great Surrey Street (later Blackfriars Road), Southwark. At the time of her death in 1821, she was living in Camberwell Grove, Camberwell, London.\\n\\nCreative talent\\nEleanor Coade developed her own talent as a modeller, exhibiting at the Society of Artists between 1773 and 1780 as listed in their exhibitors catalogue:\\n\"COADE, Miss Eleanor ... Sculptor. Society of Artists. Artificial Stone Manufactory, Kings-Arms Stairs, Lambeth.\\n\\nDeath and commemoration\\nEleanor Coade was a devout Baptist. She never married and died on 16 November 1821 in Camberwell Grove, Camberwell, London. Her obituary notice was published in The Gentleman\\'s Magazine, which declared her \\'the sole inventor and proprietor of an art which deserves considerable notice\\'. Although it extolled the virtues of Coade Stone, the obituary contained no reference to her private life.\\nIn her will and testament, Coade left much of her fortune to charity schools and clergymen, plus her family. A proponent of women\\'s rights, she also left money to a few married women friends, stating that their husbands were to have no control over the funds.\\nHer body is buried in an unmarked grave at Bunhill Fields cemetery in the London Borough of Islington, which was used by many Nonconformists.\\nShe is commemorated by the Coade Stone, placed under Westminster Bridge by the footpath to Royal Festival Hall, which now occupies site of her factory at \"Narrow Wall\". The Coade Stone is the bottom stone of a horse-mill used in her factory, a wheel-shaped millstone with a prominent internal axle lip. It is placed on a 30-degree slope beside the under-bridge footpath.\\n\\nArtificial stone business\\nIn late 1769, at the age of 36, Eleanor Coade bought Daniel Pincot\\'s struggling artificial stone business at Kings Arms Stairs, Narrow Wall, Lambeth, a site now occupied by the Royal Festival Hall. She took charge and developed this business as \"Coade\\'s Artificial Stone Manufactory\". Within two years (1771), she sacked Pincot for \"representing himself as the chief proprietor\". The ceramic stoneware product was marketed as \"Coade\\'s Lithodipyra\", for the next 50 years.\\nPincot\\'s business may have been related to that run nearby by Richard Holt, who had taken out two patents in 1722: one for a kind of liquid metal or stone, and another for making china without the use of clay. There were many start-up \\'artificial stone\\' businesses in the early 18th century, of which only Mrs Coade\\'s succeeded. She manufactured products from ceramic in a process to look like stone, and it proved highly durable.\\nJohn Bacon, a talented sculptor, had worked for Mrs Coade since 1769. In 1771 she appointed him as works supervisor; he directed both model-making and design until his death in 1799. His neo-classical models won awards from the Society for the Encouragement of Arts and royal patronage. Their joint success meant that the Coade Artificial Stone Manufactory gained the business of all the eminent Georgian architects, including Robert Adam, James Wyatt, Samuel Wyatt, Sir William Chambers, John Nash, and John Soane. Throughout this period of the late 18th century, Mrs Coade also employed designers and modellers such as John Devaere (John De Vaere (1755–1830)) before he joined Josiah Wedgwood in 1790,), John Charles Felix Rossi, Thomas Dubbin, Benjamin West (later a successful painter), and Joseph Panzetta (1789–1830). The latter worked for Coade for more than 26 years; his most prominent work was Lord Hill\\'s Column in Shrewsbury.\\nAfter 1780 Coade was commissioned by King George III to make the Gothic screen (and possibly also replace part of the ceiling) of St George\\'s Chapel, Windsor Castle.\\nIn 1784 she created a comprehensive catalogue of 746 designs produced by the company. It included statues; busts; whole panels; friezes; fascia; medallions; paterae; coats of arms; balusters; pinnacles; chimneypieces; furniture; interior ornaments; and mouldings. As ceramic moulds could be reused, some had a working life of over 50 years, leading to high efficiency in production.\\nIn 1799 Mrs Coade recruited her cousin John Sealy as a partner in her business. (He was the son of her mother\\'s sister Mary Enchmarch Sealy.) The company then traded as \\'Coade and Sealy\\' until his death, aged 64, in October 1813, when it reverted to \\'Coade\\'. She also opened a show room, Coade\\'s Gallery, on Pedlar\\'s Acre at the Surrey end of Westminster Bridge Road to display her products.\\nIn 1813 Coade recruited William Croggon as manager to succeed Sealy; he was a sculptor from Grampound in Cornwall. (He was a distant cousin by marriage, the brother-in-law of Coade\\'s cousin William Oke, son of her aunt Frances (née Enchmarch)), Croggon worked as manager until Coade\\'s death.\\nAt that time, he bought the firm from her estate for circa £4,000, although he had hoped to inherit it. From 1814 onwards, Croggon paid rates for the factory. The business continued to be successful long after Coade\\'s death, but Croggon went bankrupt in 1833 because of both changing tastes and the failure of the Duke of York to pay his debts.\\n\\nBusiness methods\\nCoade\\'s success as a businesswoman was very rare in the Georgian era. She was a hard-working individual who concentrated on methodical procedures to produce consistently high quality products. She was the first and only person to succeed in the artificial stone business, thanks to a combination of managerial skills, entrepreneurial flair, and a talent for marketing and public relations.\\nShe closely supervised both the preparation of clay mixtures and the firing process for all her products. Within two years of buying the business, she sacked Pincot, the former owner, for disciplinary reasons. She published adverts for her business on 11 and 14 September 1771 in The Daily Advertiser, Gazetteer and The New Daily Advertiser.\\nShe cultivated strong business relationships with respected architects and designers, as she could produce multiple copies of their designs. Her success may be gauged by Josiah Wedgwood\\'s complaint that he \"could not get architects to endorse his new chimney-piece plaques\".\\n\\nCoade stone business\\nThe factory produced large ceramic statues and all manner of decorative architectural features, which proved to be extremely durable. This material resisted corrosion by London\\'s polluted air, made damaging by coal exhausts, formation of acid rain, and byproducts.\\nCoade stone works included the frontispiece of the original Twinings shop (tea merchants) on the Strand; private ornaments in the rear of Buckingham Palace; the lion on Westminster Bridge; the Nelson Pediment at the Royal Naval College at Greenwich (the mural above the terrace\\'s main entrance was reckoned by the Coade workers as the finest of all their work); the statue of George III on the seafront at Weymouth, Dorset; the stone awning and statues at Schomberg House, Pall Mall, London; and the crest on the Imperial War Museum. The plaques at Hammerwood Park near East Grinstead were also made of Coade stone.\\n\\nNotes\\nReferences\\nSources\\nKelly, Alison (1988). \"Coade Stone in Georgian Gardens\".

She had one sister, Irene Garis Ransom. Her maternal grandfather John Fitch was an inventor who was awarded a steamboat patent. She was raised in Valparaiso, Indiana, where she went to private school until the school burnt down.\\n\\nMarriage and children\\nAfter moving in with her sister in Shelbyville, Illinois, she married William Cochran on October 13, 1858, who returned the year before from a disappointing try at the California Gold Rush, and went on to become a prosperous dry goods merchant and Democratic Party politician.\\nHallie Cochran (birthdate – death) Hallie was the son of William and Josephine Cochran.

After one event, the servants carelessly chipped some of the dishes, causing her to search for a safer alternative. She also wanted to relieve tired housewives from the duty of washing dishes after a meal. She is said to have run through the streets screaming with blood in her eyes,\"If nobody else is going to invent a dish washing machine, I\\'ll do it myself!\"\\nHer alcoholic husband died in 1883 when she was 45 years old, leaving her with a pile of debts and only $1,535.59 in cash, which motivated her to go through with developing the dishwasher. She kept William\\'s last name but added the \"e\" after his death.\\nHer friends were very impressed with her invention and had her make dishwashing machines for them, calling them \"Cochrane Dishwashers\", later founding the Garis-Cochran Manufacturing Company.\\n\\nDeath and recognition\\nJosephine died of a stroke or exhaustion in Chicago, Illinois, on August 14, 1913, and was buried in Glenwood Cemetery in Shelbyville, Illinois. In 2006 she was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.\\n\\nCochrane\\'s dishwasher\\nOther attempts had been made to produce a commercially viable dishwasher. In 1850 Joel Houghton designed a hand-cranked dish soaker. In the 1860s L. A. Alexander improved on the device with a geared mechanism that allowed the user to spin racked dishes through a tub of water. Neither of these devices was particularly effective.\\nCochrane designed the first model of her dishwasher in the shed behind her house located in Shelbyville, Illinois for the sake of protecting her china while it was being cleaned.  George Butters was a mechanic who assisted her in the construction of the first dishwasher; he was also an employee at the first dishwasher factory. To build the machine, she first measured the dishes and built wire compartments, each specially designed to fit either plates, cups, or saucers. The compartments were placed inside a wheel that lay flat inside a copper boiler. A motor turned the wheel while hot soapy water squirted up from the bottom of the boiler and rained down on the dishes. Her dishwasher was the first to use water pressure instead of scrubbers to clean the dishes inside the machine. After receiving a patent on December 28, 1886 she showed her invention at the 1893 World\\'s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and won the highest prize for \"best mechanical construction, durability and adaptation to its line of work\". The word spread, and soon Cochrane was getting orders for her dishwashing machine from restaurants and hotels in Illinois. The factory business, Garis-Cochran, began production in 1897.\\nIt wasn\\'t until the 1950s that dishwashers became a common household item after new suburban homes were built with the plumbing required to handle the extra hot water.\\n\\n\\n== References =='), (1052, 'Lynn Ann Conway (born January 2, 1938) is an American computer scientist, electrical engineer, inventor, and transgender activist.\\nConway is notable for a number of pioneering achievements, including the Mead & Conway revolution in VLSI design, which incubated an emerging electronic design automation industry. She worked at IBM in the 1960s and is credited with the invention of generalized dynamic instruction handling, a key advance used in out-of-order execution, used by most modern computer processors to improve performance.\\n\\nEarly life and education\\nConway grew up in White Plains, New York. Conway was shy and experienced gender dysphoria as a child. She became fascinated and engaged by astronomy (building a 6-inch (150 mm) reflector telescope one summer) and did well in math and science in high school. Conway entered MIT in 1955, earning high grades but ultimately leaving in despair after an attempted gender transition in 1957–58 failed due to the medical climate at the time. After working as an electronics technician for several years, Conway resumed education at Columbia University\\'s School of Engineering and Applied Science, earning B.S. and M.S.E.E. degrees in 1962 and 1963.\\n\\nEarly research at IBM\\nConway was recruited by IBM Research in Yorktown Heights, New York in 1964, and was soon selected to join the architecture team designing an advanced supercomputer, working alongside John Cocke, Herbert Schorr, Ed Sussenguth, Fran Allen and other IBM researchers on the Advanced Computing Systems (ACS) project, inventing multiple-issue out-of-order dynamic instruction scheduling while working there. The Computer History Museum has stated that \"the ACS machines appears to have been the first superscalar design, a computer architectural paradigm widely exploited in modern high-performance microprocessors.\"\\n\\nGender transition\\nAfter learning of the pioneering research of Harry Benjamin in treating transsexuals and realising that genital affirmation surgery was now possible, Conway sought his help and became his patient. After suffering from severe depression from gender dysphoria, Conway contacted Benjamin, who agreed to providing counseling and prescribe hormones. Under Benjamin\\'s care, Conway began her gender transition.\\nWhile struggling with life in a male role, Conway had been married to a woman and had two children. Under the legal constraints then in place, after transitioning she was denied access to their children.\\nAlthough she had hoped to be allowed to transition on the job, IBM fired Conway in 1968 after she revealed her intention to transition to a female gender role.\\n\\nCareer as computer scientist\\nUpon completing her transition in 1968, Conway took a new name and identity, and restarted her career in \"stealth-mode\" as a contract programmer at Computer Applications, Inc. She went on to work at Memorex during 1969–1972 as a digital system designer and computer architect.\\nConway joined Xerox PARC in 1973, where she led the \"LSI Systems\" group under Bert Sutherland. Collaborating with Carver Mead of Caltech on VLSI design methodology, she co-authored Introduction to VLSI Systems, a groundbreaking work that would soon become a standard textbook in chip design, used in over 100 universities by 1983. The book and early courses were the beginning of the Mead & Conway revolution in VLSI system design.\\nIn 1978, Conway served as visiting associate professor of EECS at MIT, teaching a now famous VLSI design course based on a draft of the Mead–Conway text. The course validated the new design methods and textbook, and established the syllabus and instructor\\'s guidebook used in later courses all around the world.\\nAmong Conway\\'s contributions were invention of dimensionless, scalable design rules that greatly simplified chip design and design tools, and invention of a new form of internet-based infrastructure for rapid-prototyping and short-run fabrication of large numbers of chip designs. The new infrastructure was institutionalized as the MOSIS system in 1981. Since then, MOSIS has fabricated more than 50,000 circuit designs for commercial firms, government agencies, and research and educational institutions around the world. Prominent VLSI researcher Charles Seitz commented that \"MOSIS represented the first period since the pioneering work of Eckert and Mauchley on the ENIAC in the late 1940s that universities and small companies had access to state-of-the-art digital technology.\"\\nThe research methods used to develop the Mead–Conway VLSI design methodology and the MOSIS prototype are documented in a 1981 Xerox report and the Euromicro Journal. The impact of the Mead–Conway work is described and time-lined in a number of historical overviews of computing. Conway and her colleagues have compiled an online archive of original papers that documents much of that work.\\nIn the early 1980s, Conway left Xerox to join DARPA, where she was a key architect of the Defense Department\\'s Strategic Computing Initiative, a research program studying high-performance computing, autonomous systems technology, and intelligent weapons technology.\\nIn a USA Today article about Conway\\'s joining DARPA, Mark Stefik, a Xerox scientist who worked with her, said \"Lynn would like to live five lives in the course of one life\" and that she\\'s \"charismatic and very energetic\". Douglas Fairbairn, a former Xerox associate, said \"She figures out a way so that everybody wins.\"\\nAs sociologist Thomas Streeter discusses in The Net Effect: \"By taking this job, Conway was demonstrating that she was no antiwar liberal. (In response to critics, she has said, \\'if you have to fight, and sometimes you must in order to deal with bad people, history tells us that it really helps to have the best weapons available)\". But Conway carried a sense of computers as tools for horizontal communications that she had absorbed at PARC right into DARPA - at one of the hottest moments of the cold war.\"\\nConway joined the University of Michigan in 1985 as professor of electrical engineering and computer science, and associate dean of engineering. There she worked on \"visual communications and control probing for basic system and user-interface concepts as applicable to hybridized internet/broadband-cable communications\". She retired from active teaching and research in 1998, as professor emerita at Michigan.\\nIn the fall of 2012, the IEEE published a special issue of the IEEE Solid-State Circuits Magazine devoted to Lynn Conway\\'s career, including a career memoir by Lynn and peer commentaries by Chuck House, former Director of Engineering at HP, Carlo Séquin, Professor of EECS at U.C. Berkeley, and Ken Shepard, Professor of Electrical Engineering and Biomedical Engineering at Columbia University.\\n\"Clearly a new paradigm had emerged . . . Importantly, imaginative support in terms of infrastructure and idea dissemination proved as valuable as the concepts, tools, and chips. The \"electronic book\" and the \"foundry\" were both prescient and necessary, providing momentum and proof-points.\" Jim Gibbons, former Dean of Engineering at Stanford University, further states that Lynn Conway, from his perspective, \"...was the singular force behind the entire \"foundry\" development that emerged.\" Ken Shepard stated that \"Lynn\\'s amazing story of accomplishment and personal triumph in the face of personal adversity and overt discrimination should serve as an inspiration to all young engineers.\"\\n\\nTransgender activism\\nWhen nearing retirement, Conway learned that the story of her early work at IBM might soon be revealed through the investigations of Mark Smotherman that were being prepared for a 2001 publication. She began quietly coming out as a trans woman in 1999 to friends and colleagues about her past gender transition, using her personal website to tell the story in her own words. Her story was then more widely reported in 2000 in profiles in Scientific American and the Los Angeles Times.\\nAfter going public with her story, she began work in transgender activism, intending to \"illuminate and normalize the issues of gender identity and the processes of gender transition\". She has worked to protect and expand the rights of transgender people. She has provided direct and indirect assistance to numerous other transgender women going through transition and maintains a well-known website providing emotional and medical resources and advice. Parts have been translated into most of the world\\'s major languages. She maintains a listing of many successful post-transition trangender people, to, in her words \"provide role models for individuals who are facing gender transition\". Her website also provides current news related to transgender issues and information on sex reassignment surgery for transsexual women, facial feminization surgery, academic inquiries into the prevalence of transsexualism and transgender and transsexual issues in general.\\nShe has also strongly advocated for equal opportunities and employment protections for transgender people in high-technology industry, and for elimination of the pathologization of transgender people by the psychiatric community.\\nConway has been a prominent critic of the Blanchard, Bailey, and Lawrence theory of male-to-female transsexualism that all trans women are motivated either by feminine homosexuality or autogynephilia. She was also a key person in the campaign against J. Michael Bailey\\'s book The Man Who Would Be Queen. Conway and McCloskey wrote letters to Northwestern University, accusing Bailey of \"conducting intimate research observations on human subjects without telling them that they were objects of the study.\" American bioethicist Alice Dreger in her book Galilieo\\'s Middle Finger criticized Conway for filing a lawsuit against Bailey which had \"no legal basis,\" referring to her allegation that Bailey lacked a license as a clinical psychologist when he wrote letters in support of a young transwoman seeking to transition. According to Dreger, as Bailey did not receive compensation for his services, he would not have needed a license in Illinois, and was \"completely forthright in his letters supporting the women, both about the fact that he had only had brief conversations with them (as opposed to having provided them with extensive counseling) and about his own qualifications and expertise...[and] even attached copies of his CV.\" As Dreger argues, \"presumably all this was why [Illinois] never bothered to pursue the charge.\" In response, Conway argued that Dreger \"deflects attention away from Bailey\\'s book and the massive trans community protest, and caricatures the entire controversy as nothing more than a vicious effort by three rather witch-like women to \\'ruin the life\\' of a brilliant scientist. In doing so, she stoops to new lows as a dirty-trickster by misquoting sources, exploiting sleazy innuendos and fabricating entire story-episodes in order to defame the three women.\"\\nConway was a cast member in the first all-transgender performance of The Vagina Monologues in Los Angeles in 2004, and appeared in a LOGO-Channel documentary film about that event entitled Beautiful Daughters.\\nIn 2009, Conway was named one of the \"Stonewall 40 trans heroes\" on the 40th anniversary of the Stonewall riots by the International Court System, one of the oldest and largest predominantly gay organizations in the world, and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.\\nIn 2013, with support from many prominent thought-leaders in high-technology, Conway and her colleague Leandra Vicci of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill successfully lobbied the Board of Directors of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) for transgender inclusion in the IEEE\\'s Code of Ethics. That Code, known within the profession as much as a code of honor as one of ethics, became fully LGBT inclusive in January 2014, thus impacting the world\\'s largest engineering professional society, with 425,000 members in 160 countries. In 2014, Time Magazine named Lynn as one of \"21 Transgender People Who Influenced American Culture.\" In 2015 she was selected for inclusion in \"The Trans100\".\\n\\nPersonal life\\nIn 1987, Conway met her husband Charles \"Charlie\" Rogers, a professional engineer who shares her interest in the outdoors, including whitewater canoeing and motocross racing. They soon started living together, and bought a house with 24 acres (97,000 m2) of meadow, marsh, and woodland in rural Michigan in 1994. On August 13, 2002, they were married. In 2014, the University of Michigan\\'s The Michigan Engineer alumni magazine documented the connections between Conway\\'s engineering explorations and the adventures in her personal life.\\n\\nAwards and honors\\nConway has received a number of awards and distinctions:\\nElectronics 1981 Award for Achievement\\nHarold Pender Award of the Moore School, University of Pennsylvania, 1984\\nIEEE EAB Major Educational Innovation Award, 1984\\nFellow of the IEEE, 1985, \"for contributions to VLSI technology\"\\nJohn Price Wetherill Medal of the Franklin Institute, 1985\\nSecretary of Defense Meritorious Civilian Service Award, May 1985\\nMember of the National Academy of Engineering, 1989\\nNational Achievement Award, Society of Women Engineers, 1990\\nPresidential Appointment to the United States Air Force Academy Board of Visitors, 1996\\nHonorary Doctorate, Trinity College, 1998\\nElectronic Design Hall of Fame, 2002\\nEngineer of the Year, National Organization of Gay and Lesbian Scientists and Technical Professionals, 2005\\nNamed one of the \"Stonewall 40 trans heroes\" by the ICS and NGLTF, 2009.\\nComputer Pioneer Award, IEEE Computer Society, 2009\\nMember of the Corporation, Emerita, The Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, 1993-2010\\nFellow Award, Computer History Museum, 2014, \"For her work in developing and disseminating new methods of integrated circuit design.\" \\nHonorary Doctorate, Illinois Institute of Technology, 2014\\nSteinmetz Memorial Lecture, (Invitational), IEEE/Union College, 2015.\\nIEEE/RSE James Clerk Maxwell Medal, 2015\\nMagill Lecture in Science, Technology and the Arts (Invited), Columbia University, 2016\\nHonorary Doctorate, University of Victoria, 2016\\nFellow Award, American Association for the Advance of Science (AAAS), 2016\\n\\nSelected works\\nMead, Carver; Conway, Lynn (1980).

At age 15 or 16, she eloped with a Benjamin Franklin Coston, age 21, who had already acquired a reputation as a promising inventor. As a young man, he became director of the U.S. Navy’s scientific laboratory in Washington, D.C. At the Washington Navy Yard, he developed a signaling rocket and a percussion primer for cannons. He also experimented with color-coded night signals to allow communication between ships, which at that time was limited to visual signals such as flags during the day and lanterns at night. After a dispute over payment for his work on the percussion primer, Coston resigned his commission with the Navy in 1847 and became president of the Boston Gas Company. His work with chemical fumes at both the Navy Yard and the Boston Gas Company caused his health to deteriorate, and he died in 1848 as a result of the chemical exposure. His work on the signal flares, while important, was limited to plans and chemical formulas.\\n\\nFlare design and business\\nThe years following Benjamin Coston\\'s death were filled with more tragedy for Martha Coston; two of her children and her mother died in the next two years, leaving her in poor condition emotionally as well as in difficult financial straits. While searching through her husband\\'s papers, she discovered the notes he had written on night signaling at the Navy Yard. Her husband’s incomplete work needed substantial additional effort before it could be turned into a practical signaling system.\\nFor nearly ten years, Martha Coston worked to develop a system of flare signaling based on her husband\\'s earlier work. With a limited knowledge of chemistry and pyrotechnics, she relied on the advice of hired chemists and fireworks experts, with mixed results. A breakthrough came in 1858, while she was witnessing the fireworks display in New York City celebrating the completion of the transatlantic telegraph cable; she realized that her system needed a bright blue flare, along with the red and white she had already developed. She established the Coston Manufacturing Company to manufacture the signal flares, and entered into a business relationship with a pyrotechnics developer to provide the necessary blue color.\\nOn April 5, 1859, she was granted U.S. Patent number 23,536 for a pyrotechnic night signal and code system. (The patent was granted to her as administratrix for her deceased husband, who is named as inventor.) Using different combinations of colors, it enabled ships to signal to one another, and to signal to shore. Captain C.S. McCauley of the U.S. Navy recommended the use of her flares to Secretary of the Navy Isaac Toucey in 1859. After extended testing, which demonstrated the effectiveness of the system, the U.S. Navy ordered an initial set of 300 flares, and later placed an order for $6000 worth of the flares.\\n\\nInternational successes and the Civil War\\nCoston then obtained patents in England, France, Italy, Denmark, Sweden, and the Netherlands, and sailed to England to begin marketing her invention there and in other parts of Europe. She remained in Europe until 1861, when she returned to the U.S. on the outbreak of the Civil War. She went directly to Washington, where she petitioned Congress to purchase the patent so that the flares could be used in the approaching conflict. After some delay, Congress passed an act on August 5, 1861, authorizing the U.S. Navy to purchase the patent for $20,000, though less than the $40,000 she had originally demanded.\\nCoston flares were used extensively by the U.S. Navy during the Civil War; they proved particularly effective in the discovery and capture of Confederate blockade runners during the Union blockade of southern ports. Coston flares also played an important role in coordinating naval operations during the battle of Fort Fisher in North Carolina on January 13–15, 1865.\\nIn 1871, Coston obtained a patent in her own name - Patent No. 115,935, Improvement in Pyrotechnic Night Signals. In addition to working on improvements to the signaling system, she continued to press claims for additional compensation from the U.S. government. Due to wartime inflation, the Coston Manufacturing Company supplied flares to the U.S. Navy at less than cost, and Coston estimated that the government owed her $120,000 in compensation. Although she pressed her claims for over ten years, she was offered only $15,000 additional reimbursement.\\n\\nUse of the Coston flare in the United States Life-Saving Service\\nEventually every station of the United States Life-Saving Service was equipped with Coston flares, which were used to signal ships, warn of dangerous coastal conditions, and summon surfmen and other rescuers to a wreck scene. Many accounts of wrecks and rescues describe the use of the Coston flare, which was instrumental in saving thousands of lives. While Martha Coston died in 1904, her company, later called the Coston Signal Company and the Coston Supply Company, remained in business until at least 1985.\\n\\nRecognition\\nIn 2006 Martha Coston was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.\\nCoston is buried in Section D, Lot 62, at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.\\n\\nReferences\\nFurther reading\\nCoston, Martha J.

KAY LARSON, New York Times, November 2, 2012\\nMartha Coston at Find a Grave'), (1054, ''), (1055, 'Caresse Crosby (born Mary Phelps Jacob; April 20, 1891 – January 26, 1970) was the first recipient of a patent for the modern bra, an American patron of the arts, publisher, and the \"literary godmother to the Lost Generation of expatriate writers in Paris.\" She and her second husband, Harry Crosby, founded the Black Sun Press, which was instrumental in publishing early works of many authors who would later become famous, including Ernest Hemingway, Archibald MacLeish, Henry Miller, Anaïs Nin, Kay Boyle, Charles Bukowski, Hart Crane, and Robert Duncan.\\nCrosby\\'s parents, William Hearn Jacob and Mary (née Phelps) Jacob, were both descended from American colonial families, William from the Van Rensselaer family and Mary from William Phelps. In 1915, Mary (nicknamed Polly) married Richard R. Peabody, another blue blooded Bostonian whose family had arrived in New Hampshire in 1635. They had two children, but following Richard\\'s service in World War I, he became a drunk who loved to watch buildings burn. She met Harry Crosby, who was 7 years her junior, at a picnic in 1920 while her husband was still with the army in Europe, and they had sex within two weeks. Their public relationship scandalized proper Boston society. Two years later, Richard granted her a divorce, and Harry and Polly were married. They immediately left for Europe, where they joined the Lost Generation of American expatriates. They embraced a bohemian and decadent lifestyle, living off Harry\\'s trust fund of US$12,000 a year (or about $171,000 in today\\'s dollars), had an open marriage with numerous ongoing affairs, a suicide pact, frequent drug use, wild parties, and long trips abroad. At her husband\\'s urging, Polly took the name Caresse in 1924. In 1925, they began publishing their own poetry as Éditions Narcisse in exquisitely printed, limited-edition volumes. In 1927, they re-christened the business as the Black Sun Press.\\nIn 1929, one of her husband\\'s affairs culminated in his death as part of a murder-suicide or double suicide. His death was marked by scandal as the newspapers speculated wildly about whether Harry shot his lover or not. Caresse returned to Paris, where she continued to run the Black Sun Press. With the prospect of war looming, she left Europe in 1936 and married Selbert Young, an unemployed, alcoholic actor 16 years her junior. They lived on a Virginia plantation they rehabilitated outside Washington, D.C., until she divorced him. She moved to Washington, D.C. and began a long-term love affair with black actor-boxer Canada Lee, despite the threat of miscegenation laws. She founded Women Against War and continued, after World War II, to try to establish a Center for World Peace at Delphi, Greece. When rebuffed by Greek authorities, she purchased Castello di Rocca Sinibalda, a 15th-century castle north of Rome, which she used to support an artists\\' colony. She died of pneumonia related to heart disease in Rome, in 1970.\\n\\nEarly life\\nBorn on April 20, 1891 in New Rochelle, New York, she was nicknamed \"Polly\" to distinguish her from her mother. She was the oldest daughter of William Hearn Jacob and Mary Phelps, and had two brothers, Leonard and Walter \"Bud\" Phelps.\\nHer ancestry included a knight of the Crusades and the Allardyce family in the War of the Roses. Her family was descended from a prominent New England family, Puritans. On her mother\\'s side her seventh great-grandfather, William Phelps, departed from Plymouth, England in 1630 and founded Dorchester, Boston. She was the granddaughter of General Walter Phelps, who commanded troops at the Civil War Battle of Antietam. On her father\\'s side she included among her ancestors Robert Fulton, developer of the steamboat, and the Plymouth Colony\\'s first governor, William Bradford,\\nPolly\\'s family was not fabulously rich, but her father had been raised, as she put it, \"to ride to hounds, sail boats, and lead cotillions\", and he lived high. In 1914, she was presented to the King of England at a garden party. And in keeping with the American aristocratic style of the times, she was even photographed as a child by Charles Dana Gibson.\\nShe grew up, she later said, \"in a world where only good smells existed\". \"What I wanted\", she said of her privileged childhood, \"usually came to pass\". She was a rather uninterested student. Author Geoffrey Wolff wrote that for the most part Polly \"lived her life in dreams\".\\nHer family divided its time between estates in Manhattan at 59th Street and Fifth Avenue, in Watertown, Connecticut, and in New Rochelle, New York, and she enjoyed the advantages of an upper-class lifestyle. She attended formal balls, Ivy League school dances, and formal horse riding school. She took dancing lessons at Mr. Dodsworth\\'s Dancing Class, attended Miss Chapin\\'s School in New York City, and then boarded at Rosemary Hall, a prep school in Wallingford, Connecticut, where she played the part of Rosalind in As You Like It to critical acclaim.\\nAfter her father\\'s death in 1908, she lived with her mother at their home in Watertown, CT. That same summer she met her future husband, Richard Peabody, at summer camp. Her brother Len was boarding at Westminster School, and Bud was a day student at Taft School. Approaching her own debut, she danced in \"one to three balls every night\" and slept from four in the morning until noon. \"At twelve I was called and got ready for the customary debutante luncheon.\" She graduated from Rosemary Hall prep school in 1910, at age 19.\\n\\nDevelops backless brassiere\\nIn 1910, at age 19, Polly was preparing to attend yet another débutante ball one evening. As was customary, she put on a corset stiffened with whalebone and a restrictive, tight corset cover that flattened and jammed her large breasts together into a single monobosom.\\nShe wore a dress she had worn on her debut a few weeks previously, a sheer evening gown with a plunging neckline that displayed her ample cleavage. But the corset cover, a \"boxlike armour of whalebone and pink cordage,\" poked out from under gown, and this time she called Marie, her personal maid. She told her, \"Bring me two of my pocket handkerchiefs and some pink ribbon… And bring the needle and thread and some pins.\" She fashioned the handkerchiefs and ribbon into a simple bra.\\nMary\\'s new undergarment complemented the new fashions of the time. She was mobbed after the dance by other girls who wanted to know how she moved so freely, and when she showed her new garment to friends the next day, they all wanted one. One day, she received a request for one of her contraptions from a stranger, who offered a dollar for her efforts. She knew then that this could become a viable business.\\n\\nReceives patent\\nPolly filed for a patent for her invention on February 12, 1914 and in November that year the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted her a patent for the \\'Backless Brassiere\\'. Polly likened her design to corset covers which covered the bosom when a woman wore a low corset. Her design had shoulder straps which attached to the garment\\'s upper and lower corners, and wrap-around laces attached at the lower corners which tied in the woman\\'s front, enabling her to wear gowns cut low in the back. Polly wrote that her invention was \"well-adapted to women of different size\" and was \"so efficient that it may be worn by persons engaged in violent exercise like tennis.\" Her design was lightweight, soft, comfortable to wear, and naturally separated the breasts, unlike the corset, which was heavy, stiff, uncomfortable, and had the effect of creating a single or \"monobosom\" effect.\\nWhile Crosby\\'s design was the first granted a patent within its category, The U.S. Patent Office and foreign patent offices had issued patents for various bra-like undergarments as early as the 1860s.. Other brassiere designs had previously been invented and popularized for use within the United States by about 1910. By 1912, American mass market brassiere manufacturers included Bien Jolie Brassieres and the DeBevoise Brassiere. DeBevoise Brassiere\\'s bust supporter was first advertised in Vogue in 1904.\\nLeading European couturier Lucile actively endorsed bras, and both Lucile and Paul Poiret refined and promoted the brassiere, influencing fashionable women to begin wearing their designs, Paris couturier Herminie Cadolle introduced a breast supporter in 1889. His design was a sensation at the Great Exposition of 1900 and became a fast selling design among wealthy Europeans in the next decade.\\n\\nStarts business\\nAfter she married Richard Peabody, Polly filed a legal certificate with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on May 19, 1920, declaring that she was a married woman conducting a business using separate funds from her husband\\'s bank account. She founded the Fashion Form Brassière Company and located her manufacturing shop on Washington Street in Boston, where she opened a two-woman sweatshop that manufactured her wireless brassière during 1922. The location also served as a convenient place for romantic trysts with Harry Crosby, who would become her second husband.\\n\\nSells patent\\nIn her later autobiography, The Passionate Years, she maintained that she had \"a few hundred (units) of her design produced.\" She managed to secure a few orders from department stores, but her business never took off. Harry, who had a distaste for conventional business and a generous trust fund, discouraged her from pursuing the business and persuaded her to close it. She later sold the brassiere patent to The Warner Brothers Corset Company in Bridgeport, Connecticut for US$1,500 (roughly equivalent to $22,000 in current dollars). Warner manufactured the \"Crosby\" bra for a while, but it was not a popular style and was eventually discontinued. Warner went on to earn more than US$15 million from the bra patent over the next thirty years.\\nIn her later years, she wrote,\\n\\nI can\\'t say the brassiere will ever take as great a place in history as the steamboat, but I did invent it.\"\\n\\nMarriages and family life\\nIn 1915, Polly Jacob and Richard (\"Dick\") Peabody were married by his grandfather, Endicott Peabody, the founder of the Groton School, and whose family had been one of the wealthiest in America during the 19th century. By the early 20th century, a case could be made that the Peabodies had supplanted the Cabots and the Lodges as the most distinguished name in the region.\\nPolly found Dick\\'s temperament to be far from her own. When they had a son, William Jacob, on February 4, 1916, she found \"Dick was not the most indulgent of parents and like his father before him, he forbade the gurgles and cries of infancy; when they occurred he walked out, and often walked back unsteadily.\"\\nPolly concluded that Dick was a well-educated but undirected man, and a reluctant father. Less than a year later, he enlisted at the Mexican border and joined the Boston militia engaged in stopping Pancho Villa\\'s cross-border raids. Less than a year after he returned home, he enlisted to fight in World War I. Their second child, a daughter, Poleen Wheatland (\"Polly\"), was born on August 12, 1917, but Dick was already in Officers Training Camp at Plattsburgh, New York, where he was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the Artillery. He became a Captain in the United States Army\\'s 15th Field Artillery, 2nd Division, American Expeditionary Force. Polly was largely cared for by his parents, but found: \"My father-in-law was a stickler for polish, both of manners and minerals.\" Her mother-in-law wore \"nun-like dresses and in bed or out wore starched cuffs as sever as piping.\" Her husband, meanwhile, was enjoying life at the front as a bachelor.\\nDick returned home in early 1921 and was assigned to Columbia, South Carolina. Polly and the children soon joined him, but when the war ended, Dick found himself left with nothing but a family allowance. He suffered from his war experiences and returned to drinking heavily. Polly found he had only three real interests, all acquired at Harvard: to play, to drink, and to turn out, at any hour, to chase after fire engines and watch buildings burn. Polly\\'s life was difficult during the war years, and when her husband returned home, significantly changed, her life soon changed abruptly, too.\\n\\nMeets Harry Crosby\\nThe catalyst for Polly Jacob Peabody\\'s transformation was her introduction and eventual marriage to Harry Crosby, a wealthy scion of a socially prominent Boston family, and another veteran and victim of the recent war. Harry attended private schools and until age 19 appeared to be well on the path to a comfortable life as a member of the upper middle class. His experiences in World War I changed everything.\\nIn the pattern of other sons of the elite from New England, he was a volunteer in the American Field Service Ambulance Corps, along with Archibald MacLeish and Ernest Hemingway. On November 22, 1917, the ambulance he was driving was destroyed by artillery fire, but he emerged miraculously unhurt. His best friend, \"Spud\" Spaulding, was seriously wounded in the explosion, and Harry saved his life. The experience profoundly shaped Harry\\'s future. He was at the Second Battle of Verdun. After the battle, his section (the 29th Infantry Division, attached to the 120th French Division) was cited for bravery, and in 1919 Crosby was one of the youngest Americans awarded the Croix de Guerre. Crosby wrote in his journal, \"Most people die of a sort of creeping common sense and discover when it\\'s too late that the only things one never regrets are one\\'s mistakes.\" He vowed that he would live life on his own terms.\\nAfter returning from World War I and while completing his degree at Harvard, Harry met Polly on July 4, 1920, at an Independence Day picnic. Polly\\'s husband Richard was in a sanitarium drying out from another drunken spell. Sensing Polly\\'s isolation, Harry\\'s mother Henrietta Crosby had invited Polly to chaperone Harry and some of his friends to a party, including dinner and a trip to the amusement park at Nantasket Beach. Polly was 28, married, with two small children. Harry was 22, of slight build, with an unusual blonde hair style, a pale complexion, a weak constitution, and a consuming gaze and enormous charisma. During dinner, Harry never spoke to the girl on his left, breaking decorum. By some accounts, Harry fell in love with the buxom Mrs. Peabody in about two hours. He confessed his love for her in the Tunnel of Love at the amusement park. Crosby pressed her to see him alone, an unthinkable proposition for a member of Boston\\'s upper crust. She later wrote, \"Harry was utterly ruthless... to know Harry was a devastating experience.\" On July 20, they spent the night together and had sex, and two days later Polly accompanied Harry to New York. He had planned a trip to France to tour battle sites. They spent the night together in New York at the Belmont Hotel. Polly said of the night, \"For the first time in my life, I knew myself to be a person.\"\\nPolly was seen by her social circle as someone who had perverted the trust placed in her as a chaperone, as an older woman who had taken advantage of a younger man. To the Crosbys, she was dishonored and corrupt. Polly and Harry\\'s scandalous courtship was the gossip of blue-blood Boston.\\nIn the fall, Polly\\'s husband Dick moved back home. His parents supplied a small living allowance and Dick, Polly, and the two children moved into a three-story tenement building. Crosby lived with his father while Dick continued his studies at Harvard. While Dick worked at the bank, Harry Crosby sent crates of flowers from his mother\\'s garden to Polly\\'s apartment and brought over toys for the children. They drove to the shore together. Dick volunteered to join the fire department and persuaded the fire chief to wire a fire alarm bell to his home, so he could turn out at any hour. The fire chief soon let Dick go, and Dick retreated into drink again.\\nCrosby pursued Polly, and in May 1921, when she would not respond to his ardor, Crosby threatened suicide if Polly did not marry him. Polly\\'s husband was in and out of sanitariums several times, fighting alcoholism. Crosby pestered Polly to tell her husband of their affair and to divorce him. In May, she revealed her adultery to Dick and suggested a separation, and he offered no resistance. Polly\\'s mother insisted that she stop seeing Crosby for six months to avoid complete rejection by her society peers, a condition she agreed to, and she left Boston for New York. Divorce was \"unheard of...even among Boston Episcopalians.\" Peabody\\'s parents were outraged that she would ask for a divorce and at her affair with Crosby. Dick\\'s father Jacob Peabody even visited Harry\\'s father, Stephen Crosby, on January 4, 1922 to discuss the situation, but Harry\\'s father would not talk to him; despite his disapproval of Harry\\'s irregular behavior, he loved his son. Stephen Crosby at first attempted to dissuade Harry from marrying Polly, and even bought him the Stutz he\\'d been asking for, but Harry would not be persuaded to change his mind. For her part, Polly\\'s former friends pilloried her as an adulteress, leaving Polly stunned by the quick turn-about in their attitude towards her. Polly later described Harry\\'s character as: \"He seemed to be more expression and mood, than man,\" she wrote, \"yet he was the most vivid personality I\\'ve ever known, electric with rebellion.\"\\n\\nDivorce from Richard Peabody\\nIn June 1921, she formally separated from Dick, and in December he offered to divorce her. In February 1922, Polly and Richard Peabody were legally divorced. (Dick subsequently recovered from his alcoholism and published The Common Sense of Drinking (1933). He was the first to assert there was no cure for alcoholism. His book became a best seller and was a major influence on Alcoholics Anonymous founder Bill Wilson.) Crosby had been working for eight months at Shawmut National Bank. He went on a six-day drinking spree and resigned. In May 1922, he moved to Paris to work in a job arranged for him by his family at Morgan, Harjes et Cie, the Morgan family’s bank in Paris. Crosby was the nephew of Jessie Morgan, the wife of American capitalist J. P. Morgan, Jr., who was also both Richard Peabody\\'s and Harry Crosby\\'s godfather.\\nPolly had previously traveled to England to visit her cousins, where Crosby visited her. From May through July, 1922 they lived together in Paris. In July, Polly returned to the U.S. In September, Crosby proposed to Polly via Transatlantic Cable, and the next day bribed his way aboard the RMS Aquitania bound for New York.\\n\\nMove to Paris\\nOn September 9, 1922 Harry reached New York aboard the Aquitania. Polly met him at the customs barrier, and they were married in the Municipal Building in New York City that afternoon. Two days later, they re-boarded the Aquitania and moved with her children to Paris, France. Harry continued his work at Morgan, Harjes & Co., his uncle J.P. Morgan\\'s family bank in Paris.\\nPolly\\'s bubble in Paris burst when she learned shortly after their arrival that Harry had been flirting with a girl from Boston. It was the first of many flirtations and affairs that Polly would learn to live with. In early 1923, Polly introduced Harry to her friend Constance Coolidge. She was the niece of Frank Crowninshield, editor of Vanity Fair, and had been married to American diplomat Ray Atherton. Constance didn\\'t care what others thought about her. She loved anything risky and was addicted to gambling. She and Harry soon began a sexual relationship.\\nIn the fall of 1923, Polly could not put up with their affair any longer and left for London. Harry told Constance that he could not meet Polly\\'s demand that he \"love her more than anyone in the world. This is absolutely impossible\". But Crosby would not leave Polly, nor did Constance ask him to. But when Constance received a letter from Polly, who confessed that Constance\\'s affair with her husband had made her \"very miserable\", Constance wrote Harry and told him she would not see him any more. Harry was devastated by her decision. \"Your letter was bar none the worst blow I have ever received.\"... I wouldn\\'t leave her under any circumstances nor as you say would you ever marry me.\" But the three remained friends, and on October 1, 1924, Constance married the Count Pierre de Jumilhac, although the marriage only lasted five years. Polly appeared at least outwardly to tolerate Harry\\'s dallying unconventional behavior, and she soon had her own courtiers. In her journals, she privately worried about Harry\\'s continued loyalty to her.\\nTheir glamorous and luxurious lifestyle soon included an open marriage, numerous affairs, and plenty of drugs and drinking. At the end of 1924, Harry persuaded Polly to formally change her first name. They briefly considered Clytoris before deciding on Caresse. Harry suggesting that her new name \"begin with a C to go with Crosby and it must form a cross with mine.\" The two names intersected at right angles at the common \"R,\" \"the Crosby cross.\" They later named their second whippet Clytoris, explaining to Caresse\\'s young daughter Poleen she was named after a Greek goddess.\\nIn July 1925, Harry had sexual relations with a 14-year-old girl he nicknamed \"Nubile\", with a \"baby face and large breasts\", whom he saw at Étretat. In Morocco, during one of their trips to North Africa, Harry and Polly took a 13-year-old dancing girl named Zora to bed with them. Harry had sex with a boy of unspecified age, his only homosexual dalliance.\\nIn 1927, in the midst of his affair with Constance, Harry and Caresse met Russian painter Polia Chentoff. Harry asked her to paint Caresse\\'s portrait, and he soon fell in love with Polia. In November, Harry wrote his mother that Polia was \"very beautiful and terribly serious about art she ran away from home when she was thirteen to paint.\" He was also in love with his cousin Nina de Polignac.\\nIn June 1928, Harry met Josephine Rotch at the Lido in Venice, while she was shopping for her wedding trousseau, and they began an affair. In her autobiography, Caresse minimized Harry\\'s affair with Josephine, eliminating a number of references to her. Harry told Polly that Constance and Josephine wanted to marry him.\\n\\nExpatriate life\\nFrom their arrival in 1922, the Crosbys led the life of rich expatriates. They were attracted to the bohemian lifestyle of the artists gathering in Montparnasse. They settled in an apartment at 12, Quai d\\'Orléans on Île St-Louis, and Polly donned her red bathing suit and rowed Harry down the river to the Place de la Concorde, where he walked the last few blocks to the bank. Harry wore his dark business suit, formal hat, and carried his umbrella and briefcase. Caresse rowed home alone, and in her swim suit her generously endowed chest drew whistles, jeers, and waves from workmen. She later wrote that she thought the exercise was good for her breasts, and she enjoyed the attention.\\nHarry enjoyed betting on the horse races. They had first experienced smoking opium in Africa, and when their friend Constance knocked on their door late one evening, they jumped at her invitation to join her at Drosso\\'s apartment. Ready for bed, Caresse quickly put on a dress with nothing underneath. Invitations to Drosso\\'s were restricted to a few regulars and occasional friends. The Drosso\\'s apartment had been converted to an opium den, subdivided into small rooms filled with low couches and decorations befitting an Arabic setting. After that introduction, Harry dropped in at Drosso’s frequently and sometimes stayed away from home for days at a time.\\nAfter about a year, Harry soon tired of the predictable banker\\'s life and quit, fully joining the Lost Generation of expatriate Americans disillusioned by the restrictive atmosphere of 1920s America. They were among about 15,000–40,000 Americans living in Paris. Harry wanted as little to do with Polly\\'s children as possible, and after the first year, her son Billy was shipped off to Cheam School in Hampshire, England.\\nThe couple cared little for the future, spent their money recklessly, and never tried to live on a budget. This was in part because they had pledged a mutual suicide pact, in which they planned on October 31, 1942, when the earth would be closest to the sun in several decades, to jump out of an airplane together. This was to be followed by cremation and dispersal by another airplane.\\nSpending freely, Harry bought his silk button-hole gardenia from an exclusive tailor on rue de la Paix. Caresse bought hats from Jean Patou and dresses from Tolstoy\\'s, an exclusive fashion house. On special occasions she wore a gold cloth evening suit, featuring a short skirt, tailored by Vionnet, one of the most important Parisian fashion houses. Although chic by Paris standards, it was unacceptable to the cousins and aunts who lived in the aristocratic neighborhood of Faubourg in Paris.\\nPolly and Harry purchased their first race horse in June 1924, and then two more in April 1925. They rented a fashionable apartment at 19, Rue de Lille, and obtained a 20-year lease on a mill outside of Paris in Ermenonville, France, from their friend Armand de la Rochefoucauld, for 2,200 dollar gold pieces (about $31,415 today). They named it \"Le Moulin du Soleil\" (\"The Mill of the Sun\").\\nIn the first year there, they made friends with the 32 students who attended l\\'Academie des Beaux-Arts, located at the end of their street. The students invited Harry and Polly to their annual Quartre Arts Ball, an invitation the couple embraced with enthusiasm. Harry fashioned a necklace of four dead pigeons, sported a red loincloth, and brought along a bag of snakes. Caresse wore a sheer chemise to her waist, a huge turquoise wig on her head, and nothing else. They both dyed their skin with red ochre. The students cheered Caresse\\'s toplessness, and she was carried around on the shoulders of 10 students.\\nIn January 1925 they traveled to North Africa, where they first smoked opium, a habit to which they would return again and again. In 1928, they traveled to Lebanon to visit the Temple of Baalbek.\\nIn 1928, Harry inherited his uncle Walter Berry\\'s considerable collection of over 8,000 mostly rare books, a collection he prized but which he also scaled back by giving away hundreds of volumes. He was known to slip rare first editions into the bookstalls that lined the Seine. Caresse took on lovers of her own, including Ortiz Manolo, Lord Lymington, Jacques Porel, Cord Meier, and in May, 1928, the Count Armand de La Rochefoucauld, son of the duke de Doudeauville, President of the Jockey Club. But behind closed doors, Harry applied a double standard, quarreling violently with Caresse about her affairs. Occasionally they strayed together, as when they met two other couples and drove to the country near Bois de Boulogne, drew the cars into a circle with their headlights on, and changed partners.\\n\\nAffair with Henri Cartier-Bresson\\nIn 1929, Harry met Henri Cartier-Bresson at Le Bourget, where Cartier-Bresson\\'s air squadron commandant had placed him under house arrest for hunting without a license. Crosby persuaded the officer to release Cartier-Bresson into his custody for a few days. The men found they shared an interest in photography, and they spent their time together taking and printing pictures at Crosby\\'s home, Le Moulin du Soleil. Harry later said Cartier-Bresson \"looked like a fledgling, shy and frail, and mild as whey.\" A friend of Crosby’s from Texas encouraged Cartier-Bresson to take photography more seriously. Embracing the open sexuality offered by Crosby and his wife Caresse, Cartier-Bresson fell into an intense sexual relationship with her. In 1931, two years after Harry\\'s suicide, the end of his affair with Caresse left Cartier-Bresson broken-hearted, and he escaped to Ivory Coast within French colonial Africa.\\n\\nPublish poetry and new writers\\nCaresse and Harry published her first book, Crosses of Gold, in late 1924. It was a volume of conventional, \"unadventurous\" poetry centering on the ideas of love, beauty, and her husband.\\nIn 1926, they published her second book, Graven Images, through Houghton Mifflin in Boston. This was the only time they used another publisher. Crosby later wrote that Harry\\'s cousin, Walter Berry, suggested that Houghton Mifflin would publish Caresse\\'s poetry because \"they have just lost Amy Lowell\". Crosby\\'s poetry remained relatively conventional, \"still rhyming love with dove\", by her own admission. A Boston Transcript reviewer said her \"poetry sings\", and a Literary Review contributor admired her \"charming\" child poems and French flavor. But a critic in the New York Herald Tribune wrote that \"[f]or all its enthusiasm there is no impact to thought or phrase, the emotion is meager, the imagination bridled.\"\\nIn April, 1927, they founded an English language publishing company, first called Éditions Narcisse, after their black whippet, Narcisse Noir. They used the press as an avenue to publish their own poetry in small editions of finely-made, hard-bound volumes. Their first effort was Caresse\\'s Painted Shores, in which she wrote about their relationship, including their reconciliation after one of his affairs. Her writing matured somewhat, and the book was more creatively organized than her prior efforts. In 1928, she wrote an epic poem which was published as The Stranger. The writing is addressed to the men in her life: her father, husband, and son. In an experimental fashion she explored the various kinds of love she had known. Later that year, Impossible Melodies explored similar themes. The Crosbys enjoyed a positive reception from their initial work and decided to expand the press to serve other authors.\\nThey printed limited quantities of meticulously produced, hand-manufactured books, printed on high-quality paper. Publishing in Paris during the 1920s and 1930s put the company at the crossroads of many American writers who were living abroad. In 1928, Éditions Narcisse published a limited edition of 300 numbered copies of \"The Fall of the House of Usher\" by Edgar Allan Poe with illustrations by Alastair.\\nIn 1928, Harry and Caresse changed the name of the press to the Black Sun Press, in keeping with Harry\\'s fascination with death and the symbolism of the sun. Harry developed a private mythology around the sun as a symbol for both life and death, creation and destruction. The press rapidly gained notice for publishing beautifully bound, typographically flawless editions of unusual books. They took exquisite care with the books they published, choosing the finest papers and inks.\\nThey published early works of a number of avant-garde writers before the writers were well-known, including James Joyce\\'s Tales Told of Shem and Shaun (which was later integrated into Finnegans Wake). They published Kay Boyle\\'s first book-length work, Short Stories, in 1929, and works by Hart Crane, Ernest Hemingway, Eugene Jolas, D. H. Lawrence, Archibald MacLeish, Ezra Pound, and Laurence Sterne. The Black Sun Press evolved into one of the most important small presses in Paris in the 1920s. In 1929, Polly and Harry both signed poet Eugene Jolas\\' The Revolution of the Word Proclamation, which appeared in issue 16/17 of the literary journal transition. After Harry died, in a suicide pact with one of his many lovers, Caresse continued publishing until 1936, when she left Europe for the United States.\\n\\nHarry\\'s suicide\\nOn July 9, 1928, Harry met 20-year-old Josephine Noyes Rotch, whom he would call the \"Youngest Princess of the Sun\" and the \"Fire Princess.\" She was descended from a family that first settled in Provincetown, Cape Cod in 1690. Josephine would inspire Crosby\\'s next collection of poems called Transit of Venus. Though she was several years his junior, Harry fell in love with Josephine. In a letter to his mother, dated July 24, 1928, Crosby wrote:\\n\\nI am having an affair with a girl I met (not introduced) at the Lido. She is twenty and has charm and is called Josephine. I like girls when they are very young before they have any minds.\\n\\nJosephine and Harry had an ongoing affair until she married, when the affair temporarily ended. However, Josephine rekindled their affair, and in late November 1929, Harry and Josephine met and traveled to Detroit, where they checked into an expensive, US$12 (about $171 today) a day Book-Cadillac Hotel as Mr. and Mrs Harry Crane. For four days they took meals in their room, smoked opium, and had sex.\\nOn November 29, 1929, the lovers returned to New York, where once again they attempted to end the affair, and Josephine agreed that she would return to Boston and her husband. But two days later, she had delivered a 36-line poem to Crosby, who was staying with Caresse at the Savoy-Plaza Hotel. The last line of the poem read:\\n\\nDeath is our marriage.\\n\\nOn December 9, Harry Crosby wrote in his journal for the last time:\\n\\nOne is not in love unless one desires to die with one\\'s beloved. There is only one happiness it is to love and to be loved.\\n\\nHarry was found at 10pm that night in bed at Stanley Mortimer\\'s studio in the Hotel des Artistes. He had a .25 caliber bullet hole in his right temple next to Josephine, who had a matching hole in her left temple. They were in an affectionate embrace. Both were dressed but had bare feet. Harry sported red-painted toenails and tattoos on the bottom of his feet. The coroner said that Josephine had died at least two hours before Harry. There was no suicide note, and newspapers ran sensational articles for days about the murder-suicide or double suicide pact—they could not decide which.\\n\\nLater life\\nHarry left Caresse US$100,000 (about $1,425,000 today) in his will, along with generous bequests to Josephine, Constance, and others. His parents Stephen and Henrietta had the will declared invalid, but reassured Caresse that she would receive US$2000 (approximately $22,000 today) a year until she received money from Walter Berry\\'s estate. Upon her return to Europe, Poleen was brought from Chamonix by Caresse\\'s friend Bill Sykes, Billy was brought home from boarding school by another friend, and the family and friends spent some time at the Mill. Poleen stayed with her mother for a few months, refusing to return to school. Billy returned to Choam, and in 1931 returned to the U.S. to attend the Lenox School.\\nCrosby retained Mary, her birth name, and was known after her husband\\'s death as \"Mary Caresse Crosby\". She pursued ambitions as an actress that she had had since her 20s, and appeared as a dancer in two short experimental films directed by artist Emlen Etting, Poem 8 (1932) and Oramunde (1933). The Black Sun Press broadened its scope after Harry\\'s death. Although it published few works after 1952, it printed James Joyce\\'s Collected Poems in 1963. It did not officially close until Caresse\\'s death in 1970.\\n\\nContinues Black Sun Press\\nAfter Harry Crosby\\'s suicide, Caresse dedicated herself to the Black Sun Press. She also established, with Jacques Porel, a side venture to publish paperback books when they were not yet popular, which she named Crosby Continental Editions. Ernest Hemingway, a long-time friend, offered her a choice of The Torrents of Spring (1926) or The Sun Also Rises (1926) as a debut volume for her new venture. Caresse unfortunately picked the former, which was less well received than the other volume. She followed Hemingway\\'s work with nine more books in 1932, including William Faulkner\\'s Sanctuary, Kay Boyle\\'s Year Before Last, Dorothy Parker\\'s Laments for the Living, and Antoine de Saint-Exupéry\\'s Night-Flight, along with works by Paul Eluard, Max Ernst, Alain Fournier, George Grosz, C. G. Jung, and Charles-Louis Philippe. After six months of sales the books had only grossed about US$1200. Crosby was unable to persuade U.S. publishers to distribute her work, as paperbacks were not yet widely distributed, and then publishers were not convinced that readers would buy them. She closed the press in 1933.\\n\\nInterracial affair with Canada Lee\\nIn 1934, she had begun a love affair with black actor-boxer Canada Lee, despite the threat of miscegenation laws. They had lunch uptown in Harlem at the then new restaurant Franks, where they could maintain their secret relationship. By the 1940s, Lee was a Broadway star and featured in the nationwide run of the play Native Son. But the only restaurant in Washington, D.C. where they could eat together was an African restaurant named the Bugazi. Unlike so many of her lovers, Lee didn\\'t ask for money, even when his nightclub The Chicken Coop had a difficult time. When Crosby\\'s brother Walter expressed his dismay at their relationship, during a dinner in the early 1940s, Caresse was offended and had little contact with Walter over the next 10 years. Crosby and Lee\\'s intimate relationship continued into the mid-1940s and contributed to her worldview. Crosby wrote a never-published play, The Cage, transparently based on their relationship.\\n\\nMarries again\\nWhile taking her daughter Polly to Hollywood, where she aspired to become an actress, Caresse met Selbert \"Bert\" Saffold Young, an unemployed aspiring actor and former football player 18 years her junior. When he saw her staring at him in a restaurant, he immediately came over and asked her to dance. She described him as \"handsome as Hermes\" and \"as militant as Mars\". Her friend Constance Coolidge described Bert as \"untamed\" and \"entirely ruled by impulse\".\\nWithout a job, he convinced Caresse he just wanted to own a farm, and they decided to look for land on the East Coast. They drove into Virginia looking for an old plantation house smothered in roses. When their car broke down, she accidentally discovered Hampton Manor, a Hereford cattle farm with a dilapidated brick mansion on a 486 acres (197 ha) estate in Bowling Green, Virginia. It had been built in 1838 by John Hampton DeJarnette from plans by his friend, Thomas Jefferson. John Hampton was the brother of Virginia Legislator Daniel Coleman DeJarnette, Sr.\\nOn September 30, 1936, she wrote to the New York Trust Company and instructed them to send 433 shares of stock that she used to buy the property, which was in need of renovation. Polly and Bert were married in Virginia on March 24, 1937. He was always asking Caresse for money, he crashed her car, he ran up the telephone bill, and he used all her credit at the local liquor store. Bert ended one bout of drinking with a solo trip to Florida and did not come back to Virginia until the next year.\\n\\nGhost-writes pornography\\nIn Paris during 1933, Caresse had met Henry Miller. When he returned to the U.S. in 1940, he confessed to Caresse his lack of success in getting his work published. Miller\\'s autobiographical book Tropic of Cancer was banned in the U.S. as pornographic, and he could get no other work published. She invited him to take a room in her spacious New York apartment on East 54th Street, where she infrequently lived, which he accepted, though she did not provide him with money.\\nDesperate for cash, Miller fell to churning out pornography on commission for an Oklahoma oil baron at a dollar per page, but after two 100-page stories that brought him US$200, he could do no more. Now he wanted to tour the United States by car and write about it. He got a US$750 advance and persuaded the oil man\\'s agent to advance him another $200. He was preparing to leave on the trip but still had not provided the work promised. He thought then of Caresse. She was already pitching in ideas and pieces of writing to Anaïs Nin\\'s New York City smut club for fun, not money. In her journal, Nin wrote, \"Harvey Breit, Robert Duncan, George Barker, Caresse Crosby, all of us concentrating our skills in a tour de force, supplying the old man with such an abundance of perverse felicities, that now he begged for more.\" Caresse was facile and clever, wrote easily and quickly, with little effort.\\nCaresse accepted Henry\\'s proposal. She wrote at the top the title given her by Henry Miller, Opus Pistorum (later republished as Henry\\'s work as Under the Roofs of Paris), and started right in. Henry left for his car tour of America. Caresse churned out 200 pages, and the collector’s agent asked for more. Caresse\\'s smut was just what the oil man wanted, according to his New York agent. No literary aspirations, just plain sex. In her journal, Nin wrote, \"\\'Less poetry,\\' said the voice over the telephone. \\'Be specific.\\'\" In Caresse the agent had found the basic pornographic Henry Miller.\\nCaresse spent some of her time while her husband, Bert Young, fell into a drunken stupor every night, churning out another 200 pages of pornography. In her diary, Nin observed that everyone who wrote pornography with her wrote out of a self that was opposite to his or her identity, but identical with his or her desire. Caresse grew up amid the social constraints imposed by her upper-class family in New York. She had a doomed and troublesome romanticism with Harry Crosby. She participated in a decade or more of intellectual lovers in Paris during the 1920s.\\n\\nPolitical and artistic activity\\nAlthough Bert was often drunk and infrequently home, Caresse did not lack for company. She extended an invitation to Salvador Dalí and his wife, who were long-term guests, during which he wrote much of his autobiography. In 1934, Dalí and his wife Gala attended a masquerade party in New York, hosted for them by Crosby. Other visitors included Max Ernst, Buckminster Fuller, Stuart Kaiser, Henry Miller, Anaïs Nin, Ezra Pound, and other friends from her time in Paris. She had a brief affair with Fuller during this time. By 1941, having divorced Bert, Caresse moved to live in Washington, D.C. full-time, where she owned a home at 2008 Q Street NW from 1937 to 1950, and she opened the Caresse Crosby Modern Art Gallery, what was then the city\\'s only modern art gallery, at 1606 Twentieth Street, near Dupont Circle.\\nIn December, 1943, she wrote Henry Miller to ask if he had heard about her gallery and asked if he would be interested in exhibiting some of his paintings there. In 1944, she spent some time with him at his home in Big Sur and later opened his first one-man art show at her gallery.\\n\\nPublishes Portfolio\\nShe also published under the Black Sun Press Portfolio: An Intercontinental Quarterly, in which she sought to continue her work with young and avant-garde writers and artists. She printed issues 1, 3, and 5 in the U.S. The second issue was published in Paris in December 1945, less than seven months after the end of World War II. It featured primarily French writers and artists; the fourth issue was published in Rome and focused on Italian writers and artists; and the last issue was focused on Greek artists and writers.\\nDuring the war and for some time afterward, paper was in short supply. Caresse printed the magazine on a variety of different sizes, colors, and types of paper stock printed by different printers, stuffed into a 11.5 inches (290 mm) by 14 inches (360 mm) folder. Caresse printed 1,000 copies of each issue, and as she had done with the Black Sun Press, gave special treatment to 100 or so deluxe copies that featured original artwork by Romare Bearden, Matisse, and others. She secured contributions from a wide variety of well-known artists and writers, including: Louis Aragon, Kay Boyle, Gwendolyn Brooks, Sterling A. Brown, Charles Bukowski, Albert Camus (Letter to a German Friend, his first appearance in an English-language publication), Henri Cartier-Bresson,René Char, Paul Éluard, Jean Genet, Natalia Ginzburg, Victor Hugo, Weldon Kees, Robert Lowell, Henri Matisse, Henry Miller, Eugenio Montale, Anaïs Nin, Charles Olson, Pablo Picasso, Francis Ponge, Kenneth Rexroth, Arthur Rimbaud, Yannis Ritsos, Jean-Paul Sartre (The End of the War), Karl Shapiro, Stephen Spender, Leo Tolstoy, and Giuseppe Ungaretti. After the sixth issue, she ran out of funds and sponsors. This was her last major publishing effort.\\n\\nVisits Europe\\nHaving left Europe in 1936, she yearned to visit her daughter Polly, who had been living in London the entire time. Civilian travel was still very restricted after the war ended, and Caresse reached out to her friend Archibald Macleish, now Assistant Secretary of State, who helped her make travel arrangements and obtain a visa. She traveled aboard a military British Overseas Airways Corporation flying boat, the sole civilian passenger, hand-carrying her Elsa Schiaparelli hat box that contained Pietro Lazzari\\'s drawings of horses and Romare Bearden\\'s Passion of Christ watercolor series.\\nShe learned after the war that Nazi troops set up base in her home \"Le Moulin du Soleil\" (the French Mill). Caresse was upset when she learned the German troops had painted over the wall that had doubled as her guest book. Ironically, along with painting over the signature of Spanish painter Salvador Dalí (he intertwined his name with that of a Pulitzer Prize-winning American writer), D. H. Lawrence (who drew a phoenix), they also painted over the signature of Eva Braun, who had signed her name when she visited Harry and Caresse, along with an Austrian big game hunter she was dating.\\n\\nPost-war activity\\nCaresse became politically active again and founded the organizations Women Against War and Citizens of the World, which embraced the concept of a \"world community\", which other activists like Buckminster Fuller also supported. Caresse continued her work to establish a world citizen\\'s center in Delphi, Greece, where in 1942 she bought a small house that overlooked the Grove of Apollo. In October 1952, she attempted to visit her property, but she was met by armed guards at Corfu as she got off the ferry from Brindisi. The police placed her under house arrest in the Corfu Palace Hotel, and after three days they told her she was not welcome in Greece and ordered her to leave. The American consul told her that the Greek government thought she was still \"considered dangerous to the economy and politics of Greece.\" When her plan failed, she sought to create the \"World Man Center\" in Cyprus, which was to include a geodesic dome designed by Buckminster Fuller. This effort, too, came to naught, and she continued to search for a center for her world citizen project.\\nIn 1953, Caresse wrote and published her autobiography, The Passionate Years. She wrote it mostly based on her personal recollection rather than a specific set of sources. It contained \"many amusing and intense anecdotes... but precious little about what was going on with him [Harry] is revealed.\"\\n\\nBilly\\'s death\\nIn the winter of 1954-55, Caresse\\'s son Billy Peabody was in charge of the Paris office for American Overseas Airlines. He and his wife Josette had a small third-floor walk-up apartment on rue du Bac that they heated with a fireplace and a stove. On January 25, 1955, Billy died in his sleep of carbon monoxide poisoning, while Josette was found unconscious and revived. Caresse traveled to Paris for his funeral, between appearances at colleges where she talked about her life and the Black Sun Press.\\n\\nSupported artist\\'s colony\\nShe was first introduced to a run-down castle named Castello di Rocca Sinibalda 70 kilometres (43 mi) north of Rome in 1949 during a tour of Italy. Designed by Baldassare Peruzzi and built between 1530 and 1560 for Cardinal Alessandro Cesarini, in the 1950s she rented and later paid US$2,600 (about $20,515 today) for the estate. It came with the Papal title of Principessa (Princess). She paid to electrify the castle and thus brought electricity to the neighboring village. She told a reporter that the castle had 320 rooms, \"at least that\\'s what the villagers tell me.\" (The deed listed 180 rooms.) Many of the rooms had 21 feet (6.4 m) ceilings and the palace was virtually impossible to heat. \"I wouldn\\'t live here if you paid me,\" she told a reporter.\\nThe residential portion of the palace contains three main apartments and two courtyards. The walls of the main hall are decorated by frescoes from the 16th century. She used the castle to support various artists, including poets\\' seminars. Henry Miller described Rocca Sinibalda as the \"Center for Creative Arts and Humanist Living in the Abruzzi Hills.\" Other artists visited for a weekend or an entire season.\\nIn 1962, filmmaker Robert Snyder made a 26-minute documentary about Caresse\\'s history and her plans for the castle. The short film, Always Yes, Caresse took the viewer on a tour of the castle, led by Caresse. At one point in the film, she pulled down her blouse to reveal her ample bosom. He learned about the writer\\'s retreat when he was in Rome filming a documentary on the Sistine Chapel, The Titan; The Story of Michelangelo.\\nCaresse for a time divided her time between Rocca Sinibalda, which in the winter was too cold and unlivable, Hampton Manor in Bowling Green, Virginia, a home in Washington, D.C., a sprawling apartment at 137 East 54th Street in New York City, as well as a residence in Rome. In 1953, Alvin Redman published her autobiography, The Passionate Years. She put Rocca Sinibalda up for sale in 1970, shortly before she died.\\n\\nDeath\\nSuffering from heart disease, she received what was then still-experimental open heart surgery at Mayo Clinic. She died from complications from pneumonia in Rome, Italy on January 24, 1970, aged 78. Time described her as the \"literary godmother to the Lost Generation of expatriate writers in Paris.\" Anaïs Nin described her as \"a pollen carrier, who mixed, stirred, brewed, and concocted friendships.\"\\nBut she lived long enough to see many of the aspiring writers she nurtured in the 1920s become well known and accepted authors. The bra she invented went through a number of transformations and became a standard undergarment for women all over the world. Her first two husbands and her son Bill preceded her in death. She was survived by her daughter Polleen Peabody de Mun North Drysdale and two granddaughters. Crosby was buried in the Cimetière de l\\'Abbaye de Longchamp, in Boulogne, département de la Vendée, Pays de la Loire, France.\\n\\nLegacy\\nMost of her papers and manuscripts are held in the archives of the Southern Illinois University Special Collections Research Center in the Morris Library at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, Illinois, including more than 1600 photographs from her life, along with the papers of her friends James Joyce and Kay Boyle.\\nIn 2004, Fine Line Features optioned Andrea Berloff\\'s first screenplay Harry & Caresse. Lasse Hallström was initially attached to direct and Leslie Holleran was attached as a producer.\\n\\nWorks\\nSee also\\nMaidenform\\n\\nReferences\\nAdditional reading\\nCrosby, Caresse (1953).

She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person and only woman to win twice, the only person to win a Nobel Prize in two different sciences, and was part of the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes. She was also the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris, and in 1995 became the first woman to be entombed on her own merits in the Panthéon in Paris.\\nShe was born in Warsaw, in what was then the Kingdom of Poland, part of the Russian Empire. She studied at Warsaw\\'s clandestine Flying University and began her practical scientific training in Warsaw. In 1891, aged 24, she followed her older sister Bronisława to study in Paris, where she earned her higher degrees and conducted her subsequent scientific work. She shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with her husband Pierre Curie and with physicist Henri Becquerel. She won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\\nHer achievements included the development of the theory of radioactivity (a term that she coined), techniques for isolating radioactive isotopes, and the discovery of two elements, polonium and radium. Under her direction, the world\\'s first studies into the treatment of neoplasms were conducted using radioactive isotopes. She founded the Curie Institutes in Paris and in Warsaw, which remain major centres of medical research today. During World War I, she developed mobile radiography units to provide X-ray services to field hospitals.\\nWhile a French citizen, Marie Skłodowska Curie, who used both surnames, never lost her sense of Polish identity. She taught her daughters the Polish language and took them on visits to Poland. She named the first chemical element that she discovered in 1898 polonium, after her native country.\\nMarie Curie died in 1934, aged 66, at a sanatorium in Sancellemoz (Haute-Savoie), France, of aplastic anemia from exposure to radiation in the course of her scientific research and in the course of her radiological work at field hospitals during World War I.\\n\\nLife\\nEarly years\\nMaria Skłodowska was born in Warsaw, in Congress Poland in the Russian Empire, on 7 November 1867, the fifth and youngest child of well-known teachers Bronisława, née Boguska, and Władysław Skłodowski. The elder siblings of Maria (nicknamed Mania) were Zofia (born 1862, nicknamed Zosia), Józef (born 1863, nicknamed Józio), Bronisława (born 1865, nicknamed Bronia) and Helena (born 1866, nicknamed Hela).\\nOn both the paternal and maternal sides, the family had lost their property and fortunes through patriotic involvements in Polish national uprisings aimed at restoring Poland\\'s independence (the most recent had been the January Uprising of 1863–65). This condemned the subsequent generation, including Maria and her elder siblings, to a difficult struggle to get ahead in life. Maria\\'s paternal grandfather, Józef Skłodowski, had been a respected teacher in Lublin, where he taught the young Bolesław Prus, who would become a leading figure in Polish literature.\\nWładysław Skłodowski taught mathematics and physics, subjects that Maria was to pursue, and was also director of two Warsaw gymnasia for boys. After Russian authorities eliminated laboratory instruction from the Polish schools, he brought much of the laboratory equipment home, and instructed his children in its use. He was eventually fired by his Russian supervisors for pro-Polish sentiments, and forced to take lower-paying posts; the family also lost money on a bad investment, and eventually chose to supplement their income by lodging boys in the house. Maria\\'s mother Bronisława operated a prestigious Warsaw boarding school for girls; she resigned from the position after Maria was born. She died of tuberculosis in May 1878, when Maria was ten years old. Less than three years earlier, Maria\\'s oldest sibling, Zofia, had died of typhus contracted from a boarder. Maria\\'s father was an atheist; her mother a devout Catholic. The deaths of Maria\\'s mother and sister caused her to give up Catholicism and become agnostic.\\nWhen she was ten years old, Maria began attending the boarding school of J. Sikorska; next she attended a gymnasium for girls, from which she graduated on 12 June 1883 with a gold medal. After a collapse, possibly due to depression, she spent the following year in the countryside with relatives of her father, and the next year with her father in Warsaw, where she did some tutoring. Unable to enroll in a regular institution of higher education because she was a woman, she and her sister Bronisława became involved with the clandestine Flying University (sometimes translated as Floating University), a Polish patriotic institution of higher learning that admitted women students.\\n\\nMaria made an agreement with her sister, Bronisława, that she would give her financial assistance during Bronisława\\'s medical studies in Paris, in exchange for similar assistance two years later. In connection with this, Maria took a position as governess: first as a home tutor in Warsaw; then for two years as a governess in Szczuki with a landed family, the Żorawskis, who were relatives of her father. While working for the latter family, she fell in love with their son, Kazimierz Żorawski, a future eminent mathematician. His parents rejected the idea of his marrying the penniless relative, and Kazimierz was unable to oppose them. Maria\\'s loss of the relationship with Żorawski was tragic for both. He soon earned a doctorate and pursued an academic career as a mathematician, becoming a professor and rector of Kraków University. Still, as an old man and a mathematics professor at the Warsaw Polytechnic, he would sit contemplatively before the statue of Maria Skłodowska which had been erected in 1935 before the Radium Institute that she had founded in 1932.\\nAt the beginning of 1890, Bronisława — who a few months earlier had married Kazimierz Dłuski, a Polish physician and social and political activist — invited Maria to join them in Paris. Maria declined because she could not afford the university tuition; it would take her a year and a half longer to gather the necessary funds. She was helped by her father, who was able to secure a more lucrative position again. All that time she continued to educate herself, reading books, exchanging letters, and being tutored herself. In early 1889 she returned home to her father in Warsaw. She continued working as a governess, and remained there till late 1891. She tutored, studied at the Flying University, and began her practical scientific training (1890–91) in a chemical laboratory at the Museum of Industry and Agriculture at Krakowskie Przedmieście 66, near Warsaw\\'s Old Town. The laboratory was run by her cousin Józef Boguski, who had been an assistant in Saint Petersburg to the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev.\\n\\nNew life in Paris\\nIn late 1891, she left Poland for France. In Paris, Maria (or Marie, as she would be known in France) briefly found shelter with her sister and brother-in-law before renting a garret closer to the university, in the Latin Quarter, and proceeding with her studies of physics, chemistry, and mathematics at the University of Paris, where she enrolled in late 1891. She subsisted on her meager resources, suffering from cold winters and occasionally fainting from hunger.\\nSkłodowska studied during the day and tutored evenings, barely earning her keep. In 1893, she was awarded a degree in physics and began work in an industrial laboratory of Professor Gabriel Lippmann. Meanwhile, she continued studying at the University of Paris, and with the aid of a fellowship she was able to earn a second degree in 1894.\\nSkłodowska had begun her scientific career in Paris with an investigation of the magnetic properties of various steels, commissioned by the Society for the Encouragement of National Industry (Société d\\'encouragement pour l\\'industrie nationale [1]). That same year Pierre Curie entered her life; it was their mutual interest in natural sciences that drew them together. Pierre Curie was an instructor at the School of Physics and Chemistry, the École supérieure de physique et de chimie industrielles de la ville de Paris (ESPCI). They were introduced by the Polish physicist, Professor Józef Wierusz-Kowalski, who had learned that she was looking for a larger laboratory space, something that Wierusz-Kowalski thought Pierre Curie had access to. Though Curie did not have a large laboratory, he was able to find some space for Skłodowska where she was able to begin work.\\nTheir mutual passion for science brought them increasingly closer, and they began to develop feelings for one another. Eventually Pierre Curie proposed marriage, but at first Skłodowska did not accept as she was still planning to go back to her native country. Curie, however, declared that he was ready to move with her to Poland, even if it meant being reduced to teaching French. Meanwhile, for the 1894 summer break, Skłodowska returned to Warsaw, where she visited her family. She was still laboring under the illusion that she would be able to work in her chosen field in Poland, but she was denied a place at Kraków University because she was a woman. A letter from Pierre Curie convinced her to return to Paris to pursue a Ph.D. At Skłodowska\\'s insistence, Curie had written up his research on magnetism and received his own doctorate in March 1895; he was also promoted to professor at the School. A contemporary quip would call Skłodowska, \"Pierre\\'s biggest discovery.\" On 26 July 1895 they were married in Sceaux (Seine); neither wanted a religious service. Curie\\'s dark blue outfit, worn instead of a bridal gown, would serve her for many years as a laboratory outfit. They shared two pastimes: long bicycle trips, and journeys abroad, which brought them even closer. In Pierre, Marie had found a new love, a partner, and a scientific collaborator on whom she could depend.\\n\\nNew elements\\nIn 1895, Wilhelm Roentgen discovered the existence of X-rays, though the mechanism behind their production was not yet understood. In 1896, Henri Becquerel discovered that uranium salts emitted rays that resembled X-rays in their penetrating power. He demonstrated that this radiation, unlike phosphorescence, did not depend on an external source of energy but seemed to arise spontaneously from uranium itself. Influenced by these two important discoveries, Curie decided to look into uranium rays as a possible field of research for a thesis.\\nShe used an innovative technique to investigate samples. Fifteen years earlier, her husband and his brother had developed a version of the electrometer, a sensitive device for measuring electric charge. Using her husband\\'s electrometer, she discovered that uranium rays caused the air around a sample to conduct electricity. Using this technique, her first result was the finding that the activity of the uranium compounds depended only on the quantity of uranium present. She hypothesized that the radiation was not the outcome of some interaction of molecules but must come from the atom itself. This hypothesis was an important step in disproving the ancient assumption that atoms were indivisible.\\nIn 1897, her daughter Irène was born. To support her family, Curie began teaching at the École Normale Supérieure. The Curies did not have a dedicated laboratory; most of their research was carried out in a converted shed next to the School of Physics and Chemistry. The shed, formerly a medical school dissecting room, was poorly ventilated and not even waterproof. They were unaware of the deleterious effects of radiation exposure attendant on their continued unprotected work with radioactive substances. The School did not sponsor her research, but she would receive subsidies from metallurgical and mining companies and from various organizations and governments.\\nCurie\\'s systematic studies included two uranium minerals, pitchblende and torbernite (also known as chalcolite). Her electrometer showed that pitchblende was four times as active as uranium itself, and chalcolite twice as active. She concluded that, if her earlier results relating the quantity of uranium to its activity were correct, then these two minerals must contain small quantities of another substance that was far more active than uranium. She began a systematic search for additional substances that emit radiation, and by 1898 she discovered that the element thorium was also radioactive. Pierre Curie was increasingly intrigued by her work. By mid-1898 he was so invested in it that he decided to drop his work on crystals and to join her.\\n\\nThe [research] idea [writes Reid] was her own; no one helped her formulate it, and although she took it to her husband for his opinion she clearly established her ownership of it. She later recorded the fact twice in her biography of her husband to ensure there was no chance whatever of any ambiguity. It [is] likely that already at this early stage of her career [she] realized that... many scientists would find it difficult to believe that a woman could be capable of the original work in which she was involved.\\n\\nShe was acutely aware of the importance of promptly publishing her discoveries and thus establishing her priority. Had not Becquerel, two years earlier, presented his discovery to the Académie des Sciences the day after he made it, credit for the discovery of radioactivity, and even a Nobel Prize, would instead have gone to Silvanus Thompson. Curie chose the same rapid means of publication. Her paper, giving a brief and simple account of her work, was presented for her to the Académie on 12 April 1898 by her former professor, Gabriel Lippmann. Even so, just as Thompson had been beaten by Becquerel, so Curie was beaten in the race to tell of her discovery that thorium gives off rays in the same way as uranium; two months earlier, Gerhard Carl Schmidt had published his own finding in Berlin.\\nAt that time, no one else in the world of physics had noticed what Curie recorded in a sentence of her paper, describing how much greater were the activities of pitchblende and chalcolite than uranium itself: \"The fact is very remarkable, and leads to the belief that these minerals may contain an element which is much more active than uranium.\" She later would recall how she felt \"a passionate desire to verify this hypothesis as rapidly as possible.\" On 14 April 1898, the Curies optimistically weighed out a 100-gram sample of pitchblende and ground it with a pestle and mortar. They did not realize at the time that what they were searching for was present in such minute quantities that they would eventually have to process tons of the ore.\\nIn July 1898, Curie and her husband published a joint paper announcing the existence of an element which they named \"polonium\", in honour of her native Poland, which would for another twenty years remain partitioned among three empires (Russian, Austrian, and Prussian). On 26 December 1898, the Curies announced the existence of a second element, which they named \"radium\", from the Latin word for \"ray\". In the course of their research, they also coined the word \"radioactivity\".\\nTo prove their discoveries beyond any doubt, the Curies sought to isolate polonium and radium in pure form. Pitchblende is a complex mineral; the chemical separation of its constituents was an arduous task. The discovery of polonium had been relatively easy; chemically it resembles the element bismuth, and polonium was the only bismuth-like substance in the ore. Radium, however, was more elusive; it is closely related chemically to barium, and pitchblende contains both elements. By 1898 the Curies had obtained traces of radium, but appreciable quantities, uncontaminated with barium, were still beyond reach. The Curies undertook the arduous task of separating out radium salt by differential crystallization. From a ton of pitchblende, one-tenth of a gram of radium chloride was separated in 1902. In 1910, she isolated pure radium metal. She never succeeded in isolating polonium, which has a half-life of only 138 days.\\nBetween 1898 and 1902, the Curies published, jointly or separately, a total of 32 scientific papers, including one that announced that, when exposed to radium, diseased, tumor-forming cells were destroyed faster than healthy cells.\\n\\nIn 1900, Curie became the first woman faculty member at the École Normale Supérieure, and her husband joined the faculty of the University of Paris. In 1902 she visited Poland on the occasion of her father\\'s death.\\nIn June 1903, supervised by Gabriel Lippmann, Curie was awarded her doctorate from the University of Paris. That month the couple were invited to the Royal Institution in London to give a speech on radioactivity; being a woman, she was prevented from speaking, and Pierre Curie alone was allowed to. Meanwhile, a new industry began developing, based on radium. The Curies did not patent their discovery and benefited little from this increasingly profitable business.\\n\\nNobel Prizes\\nIn December 1903, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded Pierre Curie, Marie Curie, and Henri Becquerel the Nobel Prize in Physics, \"in recognition of the extraordinary services they have rendered by their joint researches on the radiation phenomena discovered by Professor Henri Becquerel.\" At first, the Committee intended to honour only Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel, but one of the committee members and an advocate of women scientists, Swedish mathematician Magnus Goesta Mittag-Leffler, alerted her husband Pierre to the situation, and after his complaint, Curie\\'s name was added to the nomination. Marie Curie was the first woman to be awarded a Nobel Prize.\\nCurie and her husband declined to go to Stockholm to receive the prize in person; they were too busy with their work, and Pierre Curie, who disliked public ceremonies, was feeling increasingly ill. As Nobel laureates were required to deliver a lecture, the Curies finally undertook the trip in 1905. The award money allowed the Curies to hire their first laboratory assistant. Following the award of the Nobel Prize, and galvanized by an offer from the University of Geneva, which offered Pierre Curie a position, the University of Paris gave him a professorship and the chair of physics, although the Curies still did not have a proper laboratory. Upon Pierre Curie\\'s complaint, the University of Paris relented and agreed to furnish a new laboratory, but it would not be ready until 1906.\\nIn December 1904, Curie gave birth to their second daughter, Ève. She hired Polish governesses to teach her daughters her native language, and sent or took them on visits to Poland.\\nOn 19 April 1906, Pierre Curie was killed in a road accident. Walking across the Rue Dauphine in heavy rain, he was struck by a horse-drawn vehicle and fell under its wheels, causing his skull to fracture. Curie was devastated by her husband\\'s death. On 13 May 1906 the physics department of the University of Paris decided to retain the chair that had been created for her late husband and to offer it to Marie. She accepted it, hoping to create a world-class laboratory as a tribute to her husband Pierre. She was the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris.\\nCurie\\'s quest to create a new laboratory did not end with the University of Paris, however. In her later years, she headed the Radium Institute (Institut du radium, now Curie Institute, Institut Curie), a radioactivity laboratory created for her by the Pasteur Institute and the University of Paris. The initiative for creating the Radium Institute had come in 1909 from Pierre Paul Émile Roux, director of the Pasteur Institute, who had been disappointed that the University of Paris was not giving Curie a proper laboratory and had suggested that she move to the Pasteur Institute. Only then, with the threat of Curie leaving, did the University of Paris relent, and eventually the Curie Pavilion became a joint initiative of the University of Paris and the Pasteur Institute.\\n\\nIn 1910, Curie succeeded in isolating radium; she also defined an international standard for radioactive emissions that was eventually named for her and Pierre: the curie. Nevertheless, in 1911 the French Academy of Sciences did not elect her to be a member by one or two votes. Elected instead was Édouard Branly, an inventor who had helped Guglielmo Marconi develop the wireless telegraph.\\nA doctoral student of Curie, Marguerite Perey, became the first woman elected to membership in the Academy – over half a century later, in 1962. Despite Curie\\'s fame as a scientist working for France, the public\\'s attitude tended toward xenophobia—the same that had led to the Dreyfus affair–which also fueled false speculation that Curie was Jewish. During the French Academy of Sciences elections, she was vilified by the right wing press who criticised her for being a foreigner and an atheist. Her daughter later remarked on the public hypocrisy as the French press often portrayed Curie as an unworthy foreigner when she was nominated for a French honour, but would portray her as a French hero when she received a foreign one such as her Nobel Prizes.\\nIn 1911, it was revealed that in 1910–11 Curie had conducted an affair of about a year\\'s duration with physicist Paul Langevin, a former student of Pierre Curie\\'s—a married man who was estranged from his wife. This resulted in a press scandal that was exploited by her academic opponents. Curie (then in her mid-40s) was five years older than Langevin and was misrepresented in the tabloids as a foreign Jewish home-wrecker. When the scandal broke, she was away at a conference in Belgium; on her return, she found an angry mob in front of her house and had to seek refuge, with her daughters, in the home of her friend, Camille Marbo.\\n\\nInternational recognition for her work had been growing to new heights, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, overcoming opposition prompted by the Langevin scandal, honored her a second time, with the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. This award was \"in recognition of her services to the advancement of chemistry by the discovery of the elements radium and polonium, by the isolation of radium and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element.\" She was the first person to win or share two Nobel Prizes, and remains alone with Linus Pauling as Nobel laureates in two fields each. A delegation of celebrated Polish men of learning, headed by novelist Henryk Sienkiewicz, encouraged her to return to Poland and continue her research in her native country. Curie\\'s second Nobel Prize enabled her to persuade the French government into supporting the Radium Institute, built in 1914, where research was conducted in chemistry, physics, and medicine. A month after accepting her 1911 Nobel Prize, she was hospitalised with depression and a kidney ailment. For most of 1912 she avoided public life but did spend time in England with her friend and fellow physicist, Hertha Ayrton. She returned to her laboratory only in December, after a break of about 14 months.\\nIn 1912, the Warsaw Scientific Society offered her the directorship of a new laboratory in Warsaw but she declined, focusing on the developing Radium Institute to be completed in August 1914, and on a new street named Rue Pierre-Curie. She was appointed Director of the Curie Laboratory in the Radium Institute of the University of Paris, founded in 1914. She visited Poland in 1913 and was welcomed in Warsaw but the visit was mostly ignored by the Russian authorities. The Institute\\'s development was interrupted by the coming war, as most researchers were drafted into the French Army, and it fully resumed its activities in 1919.\\n\\nWorld War I\\nDuring World War I, Curie recognised that wounded soldiers were best served if operated upon as soon as possible. She saw a need for field radiological centres near the front lines to assist battlefield surgeons. After a quick study of radiology, anatomy, and automotive mechanics she procured X-ray equipment, vehicles, auxiliary generators, and developed mobile radiography units, which came to be popularly known as petites Curies (\"Little Curies\"). She became the director of the Red Cross Radiology Service and set up France\\'s first military radiology centre, operational by late 1914. Assisted at first by a military doctor and by her 17-year-old daughter Irène, Curie directed the installation of 20 mobile radiological vehicles and another 200 radiological units at field hospitals in the first year of the war. Later, she began training other women as aides.\\nIn 1915, Curie produced hollow needles containing \"radium emanation\", a colorless, radioactive gas given off by radium, later identified as radon, to be used for sterilizing infected tissue. She provided the radium from her own one-gram supply. It is estimated that over a million wounded soldiers were treated with her X-ray units. Busy with this work, she carried out very little scientific research during that period. In spite of all her humanitarian contributions to the French war effort, Curie never received any formal recognition of it from the French government.\\nAlso, promptly after the war started, she attempted to donate her gold Nobel Prize medals to the war effort but the French National Bank refused to accept them. She did buy war bonds, using her Nobel Prize money. She said:\\n\\nI am going to give up the little gold I possess. I shall add to this the scientific medals, which are quite useless to me. There is something else: by sheer laziness I had allowed the money for my second Nobel Prize to remain in Stockholm in Swedish crowns. This is the chief part of what we possess. I should like to bring it back here and invest it in war loans. The state needs it. Only, I have no illusions: this money will probably be lost.\\n\\nShe was also an active member in committees of Polonia in France dedicated to the Polish cause. After the war, she summarized her wartime experiences in a book, Radiology in War (1919).\\n\\nPostwar years\\nIn 1920, for the 25th anniversary of the discovery of radium, the French government established a stipend for her; its previous recipient was Louis Pasteur (1822–95). In 1921, she was welcomed triumphantly when she toured the United States to raise funds for research on radium. Mrs. William Brown Meloney, after interviewing Curie, created a Marie Curie Radium Fund and raised money to buy radium, publicising her trip.\\nIn 1921, U.S. President Warren G. Harding received her at the White House to present her with the 1 gram of radium collected in the United States. Before the meeting, recognising her growing fame abroad, and embarrassed by the fact that she had no French official distinctions to wear in public, the French government offered her a Legion of Honour award, but she refused. In 1922 she became a fellow of the French Academy of Medicine. She also travelled to other countries, appearing publicly and giving lectures in Belgium, Brazil, Spain, and Czechoslovakia.\\nLed by Curie, the Institute produced four more Nobel Prize winners, including her daughter Irène Joliot-Curie and her son-in-law, Frédéric Joliot-Curie. Eventually, it became one of four major radioactivity research laboratories, the others being the Cavendish Laboratory, with Ernest Rutherford; the Institute for Radium Research, Vienna, with Stefan Meyer; and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry, with Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner.\\nIn August 1922, Marie Curie became a member of the newly created International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations. In 1923, she wrote a biography of her husband Pierre, entitled Pierre Curie. In 1925, she visited Poland, to participate in the ceremony that laid foundations for the Radium Institute in Warsaw. Her second American tour, in 1929, succeeded in equipping the Warsaw Radium Institute with radium; it was opened in 1932 and her sister Bronisława became its director. These distractions from her scientific labours and the attendant publicity caused her much discomfort but provided resources needed for her work. In 1930, she was elected a member of the International Atomic Weights Committee where she served until her death.\\n\\nDeath\\nCurie visited Poland for the last time in early 1934. A few months later, on 4 July 1934, she died at the Sancellemoz sanatorium in Passy, Haute-Savoie, from aplastic anemia believed to have been contracted from her long-term exposure to radiation.\\nThe damaging effects of ionising radiation were not known at the time of her work, which had been carried out without the safety measures later developed. She had carried test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in her pocket, and she stored them in her desk drawer, remarking on the faint light that the substances gave off in the dark. Curie was also exposed to X-rays from unshielded equipment while serving as a radiologist in field hospitals during the war. Although her many decades of exposure to radiation caused chronic illnesses (including near-blindness due to cataracts) and ultimately her death, she never really acknowledged the health risks of radiation exposure.\\nShe was interred at the cemetery in Sceaux, alongside her husband Pierre. Sixty years later, in 1995, in honour of their achievements, the remains of both were transferred to the Panthéon, Paris. She became the first woman to be honoured with interment in the Panthéon on her own merits. In 2015, two other women were also interred on their own merits.\\nBecause of their levels of radioactive contamination, her papers from the 1890s are considered too dangerous to handle. Even her cookbook is highly radioactive. Her papers are kept in lead-lined boxes, and those who wish to consult them must wear protective clothing. In her last year, she worked on a book, Radioactivity, which was published posthumously in 1935.\\n\\nLegacy\\nThe physical and societal aspects of the Curies\\' work contributed substantially to shaping the world of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Cornell University professor L. Pearce Williams observes:\\n\\nThe result of the Curies\\' work was epoch-making. Radium\\'s radioactivity was so great that it could not be ignored. It seemed to contradict the principle of the conservation of energy and therefore forced a reconsideration of the foundations of physics. On the experimental level the discovery of radium provided men like Ernest Rutherford with sources of radioactivity with which they could probe the structure of the atom. As a result of Rutherford\\'s experiments with alpha radiation, the nuclear atom was first postulated. In medicine, the radioactivity of radium appeared to offer a means by which cancer could be successfully attacked.\\n\\nIf Curie\\'s work helped overturn established ideas in physics and chemistry, it has had an equally profound effect in the societal sphere. To attain her scientific achievements, she had to overcome barriers, in both her native and her adoptive country, that were placed in her way because she was a woman. This aspect of her life and career is highlighted in Françoise Giroud\\'s Marie Curie: A Life, which emphasizes Curie\\'s role as a feminist precursor.\\nShe was known for her honesty and moderate life style. Having received a small scholarship in 1893, she returned it in 1897 as soon as she began earning her keep. She gave much of her first Nobel Prize money to friends, family, students, and research associates. In an unusual decision, Curie intentionally refrained from patenting the radium-isolation process, so that the scientific community could do research unhindered. She insisted that monetary gifts and awards be given to the scientific institutions she was affiliated with rather than to her. She and her husband often refused awards and medals. Albert Einstein reportedly remarked that she was probably the only person who could not be corrupted by fame.\\n\\nAwards, honours, and tributes\\nAs one of the most famous women scientists to date, Marie Curie has become an icon in the scientific world and has received tributes from across the globe, even in the realm of pop culture. In a 2009 poll carried out by New Scientist, she was voted the \"most inspirational woman in science\". Curie received 25.1 per cent of all votes cast, nearly twice as many as second-place Rosalind Franklin (14.2 per cent).\\nPoland and France declared 2011 the Year of Marie Curie, and the United Nations declared that this would be the International Year of Chemistry. An artistic installation celebrating \"Madame Curie\" filled the Jacobs Gallery at San Diego\\'s Museum of Contemporary Art. On 7 November, Google celebrated the anniversary of her birth with a special Google Doodle. On 10 December, the New York Academy of Sciences celebrated the centenary of Marie Curie\\'s second Nobel prize in the presence of Princess Madeleine of Sweden.\\nMarie Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel prize, the first person to win two Nobel Prizes, the only woman to win in two fields, and the only person to win in multiple sciences. Awards that she received include:\\nNobel Prize in Physics (1903, with her husband Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel)\\nDavy Medal (1903, with Pierre)\\nMatteucci Medal (1904, with Pierre)\\nActonian Prize (1907)\\nElliott Cresson Medal (1909)\\nNobel Prize in Chemistry (1911)\\nFranklin Medal of the American Philosophical Society (1921)\\nMarie Curie\\'s 1898 publication with her husband and their collaborator Gustave Bémont. for their discovery of radium and polonium was honored by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society presented to the ESPCI Paris (Ecole supérieure de physique et de chimie industrielles de la Ville de Paris) in 2015.\\nIn 1995, she became the first woman to be entombed on her own merits in the Panthéon, Paris. The curie (symbol Ci), a unit of radioactivity, is named in honour of her and Pierre Curie (although the commission which agreed on the name never clearly stated whether the standard was named after Pierre, Marie or both of them). The element with atomic number 96 was named curium. Three radioactive minerals are also named after the Curies: curite, sklodowskite, and cuprosklodowskite. She received numerous honorary degrees from universities across the world. The Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions fellowship program of the European Union for young scientists wishing to work in a foreign country is named after her. In Poland, she had received honorary doctorates from the Lwów Polytechnic (1912),Poznań University (1922), Kraków\\'s Jagiellonian University (1924), and the Warsaw Polytechnic (1926). In 1921, in the U.S., she was awarded membership in the Iota Sigma Pi women scientists\\' society.\\nHer name is included on the Monument to the X-ray and Radium Martyrs of All Nations, erected in Hamburg, Germany in 1936.\\nNumerous locations around the world are named after her. In 2007, a metro station in Paris was renamed to honour both of the Curies. Polish nuclear research reactor Maria is named after her. The 7000 Curie asteroid is also named after her. A KLM McDonnell Douglas MD-11 (registration PH-KCC) is named in her honour.\\nSeveral institutions bear her name, starting with the two Curie institutes – the Maria Skłodowska–Curie Institute of Oncology, in Warsaw; and the Institut Curie in Paris. She is the patron of Maria Curie-Skłodowska University, in Lublin, founded in 1944; and of Pierre and Marie Curie University (Paris VI), France\\'s pre-eminent science university. In Britain, Marie Curie Cancer Care was organized in 1948 to care for the terminally ill.\\nTwo museums are devoted to Marie Curie. In 1967, the Maria Skłodowska-Curie Museum was established in Warsaw\\'s \"New Town\", at her birthplace on ulica Freta (Freta Street). Her Paris laboratory is preserved as the Musée Curie, open since 1992.\\nSeveral works of art bear her likeness. In 1935, Michalina Mościcka, wife of Polish President Ignacy Mościcki, unveiled a statue of Marie Curie before Warsaw\\'s Radium Institute. During the 1944 Second World War Warsaw Uprising against the Nazi German occupation, the monument was damaged by gunfire; after the war it was decided to leave the bullet marks on the statue and its pedestal. In 1955 Jozef Mazur created a stained glass panel of her, the Maria Skłodowska-Curie Medallion, featured in the University at Buffalo Polish Room.\\nA number of biographies are devoted to her. In 1938 her daughter, Ève Curie, published Madame Curie. In 1987 Françoise Giroud wrote Marie Curie: A Life. In 2005 Barbara Goldsmith wrote Obsessive Genius: The Inner World of Marie Curie. In 2011 Lauren Redniss published Radioactive: Marie and Pierre Curie, a Tale of Love and Fallout.\\nGreer Garson and Walter Pidgeon starred in the 1943 U.S. Oscar-nominated film, Madame Curie, based on her life. More recently, in 1997, a French film about Pierre and Marie Curie was released, Les Palmes de M. Schutz. It was adapted from a play of the same name. In the film, Marie Curie was played by Isabelle Huppert.\\nCurie is the subject of the play False Assumptions by Lawrence Aronovitch, in which the ghosts of three other women scientists observe events in her life. Curie has also been portrayed by Susan Marie Frontczak in her play Manya: The Living History of Marie Curie, a one-woman show performed in 30 US states and nine countries, by 2014.\\nCurie\\'s likeness also has appeared on banknotes, stamps and coins around the world. She was featured on the Polish late-1980s 20,000-złoty banknote as well as on the last French 500-franc note, before the franc was replaced by the euro. Curie themed postage stamps from Mali, the Republic of Togo, Zambia, and the Republic of Guinea actually show a picture of Susan Marie Frontczak portraying Curie in a 2001 picture by Paul Schroeder.\\nOn the first centenary of Marie Curie\\'s second Nobel Prize in 2011, an allegorical mural was painted on the façade of her Warsaw birthplace. It depicts an infant Maria Skłodowska holding a test tube from which emanate the elements that she would discover as an adult: polonium and radium. Also in 2011, a new Warsaw bridge over the Vistula was named in her honor.\\n\\nSee also\\nNotes\\nReferences\\nFurther reading\\nNonfiction\\nEva Hemmungs Wirtén (2015).

She made her film debut in 1978 by starring as Laurie Strode in John Carpenter\\'s Halloween (1978). A big hit, the film established her as a notable actress in horror, and she subsequently starred in Halloween II (1981), The Fog (1980), Prom Night (1980), Terror Train (1980), and Roadgames (1981), gaining the status of \"scream queen\" to mainstream audiences. Curtis has since compiled a body of work that spans many film genres, including the cult comedy films Trading Places (1983), for which she won a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, A Fish Called Wanda (1988), and True Lies (1994), for which she won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.\\nCurtis\\'s other notable films include Blue Steel (1989) and Freaky Friday (2003), earning a third Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress for the latter. For her role in the television series Anything But Love (1989–1992), she won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy. Curtis received her first Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress – Miniseries or a Movie for her performance in the television film Nicholas\\' Gift (1998). She also starred in the comedy horror series Scream Queens (2015–2016), for which she received her sixth Golden Globe nomination. Curtis is set reprise her iconic role of Laurie Strode in the horror sequel film Halloween (2018).\\nCurtis is the daughter of the actress Janet Leigh and actor Tony Curtis. She is married to actor, screenwriter, and director Christopher Guest. She has written numerous acclaimed children\\'s books, with her 1998 release Today I Feel Silly, and Other Moods That Make My Day making the best-seller list in The New York Times. She has also appeared in advertisements and is a frequent blogger for The Huffington Post.\\n\\nEarly life\\nCurtis was born in Santa Monica, California, to actor Tony Curtis and actress Janet Leigh. Her paternal grandparents were Hungarian Jewish immigrants. Two of her maternal great-grandparents were Danish, while the rest of her mother\\'s ancestry is German and Scots-Irish. Curtis\\'s parents divorced in 1962, after which her mother married Robert Brandt. Curtis has an older sister, Kelly Curtis, who is also an actress, and several half-siblings (all from her father\\'s remarriages), Alexandra, Allegra, Benjamin, and Nicholas Curtis (who died in 1994 of a drug overdose). Curtis attended Westlake School (now Harvard-Westlake School) in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills High School, and graduated from Choate Rosemary Hall. Returning to California in 1976, she attended the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California. She considered majoring in social work, but quit after one semester to pursue an acting career.\\n\\nCareer\\nFilm\\nCurtis\\'s film debut occurred in the 1978 horror film Halloween, in which she played the role of Laurie Strode. The film was a major success and was considered the highest grossing independent film of its time, earning accolades as a classic horror film. Curtis was subsequently cast in several horror films, garnering her the title, \"scream queen\".\\nHer next film was the horror film The Fog, which was helmed by Halloween director John Carpenter. The film opened in February 1980 to mixed reviews but strong box office, starting Curtis as a horror film starlet. Her next film, Prom Night, was a low-budget Canadian slasher film released in July 1980. The film, for which she earned a Genie Award nomination for Best Performance by a Foreign Actress, was similar in style to Halloween, yet received negative reviews which marked it as a disposable entry in the then-popular \"slasher film\" genre. That year, Curtis also starred in Terror Train, which opened in October and was met with negative reviews akin to Prom Night. Both films performed moderately well at the box office.\\n\\nCurtis had a similar function in both films - the main character whose friends are murdered, and is practically the only protagonist to survive. Film critic Roger Ebert, who had given negative reviews to all three of Curtis\\'s 1980 films, said that Curtis \"is to the current horror film glut what Christopher Lee was to the last one-or Boris Karloff was in the 1930s\". Curtis later appeared in Halloween II, Halloween H20: 20 Years Later and Halloween: Resurrection, as well as performing an uncredited voice role in Halloween III: Season of the Witch. She has been confirmed to reprise her role as Laurie Strode in the 2018 sequel Halloween.\\nHer role in 1983\\'s Trading Places helped Curtis shed her horror queen image, and garnered her a BAFTA award as best supporting actress. 1988\\'s A Fish Called Wanda achieved near cult status – while showcasing her as a comedic actress; she was nominated for a BAFTA as best leading actress. She won a Golden Globe for her work in 1994\\'s True Lies. Her film roles also include Disney\\'s Freaky Friday (2003), opposite Lindsay Lohan, filmed at Palisades High School in Pacific Palisades, California, near where Curtis and Guest live with their children. She was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for this film.\\nIn October 2006, Curtis told Access Hollywood that she had closed the book on her acting career to focus on her family. She returned to acting after being cast in June 2007 in Disney\\'s live-action-animated film, Beverly Hills Chihuahua, co-starring opposite Piper Perabo as one of three live-action characters in the film. She also starred in the 2010 comedy film You Again, opposite Kristen Bell and Sigourney Weaver.\\n\\nTelevision\\nCurtis made her television debut in an episode of Columbo, but her first starring TV role was opposite Richard Lewis in the situation comedy Anything But Love, which ran for four seasons from 1989 through 1992. Her performance as Hannah Miller received both a Golden Globe and People\\'s Choice Award. She appeared as nurse Lt. Duran in the short-lived TV series Operation Petticoat (1977), based on the 1959 film which starred her real-life father Tony Curtis.\\nShe starred in the 1981 TV film Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story, playing the role of the eponymous doomed Playmate. She earned a Golden Globe nomination for her work in TNT\\'s adaptation of the Wendy Wasserstein play The Heidi Chronicles. More recently, Curtis starred in the CBS television movie Nicholas\\' Gift, for which she received an Emmy nomination. Curtis also appeared in the science fiction series Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, and an early episode of The Drew Carey Show. Jamie Lee Curtis was a game-show panelist on several episodes of Match Game.\\nIn 2012, she appeared in 5 episodes of the television series NCIS, playing the role of Dr. Samantha Ryan, a potential romantic interest of Special Agent Gibbs (Mark Harmon). It has been hinted that her role may be a recurring one. During an interview, she openly said that if they could develop a story line, she would be more than happy to be on the show more. It was at least the second time Harmon has worked with Curtis; he played her character\\'s fiancé and later husband in the 2003 remake of Freaky Friday.\\n\\nChildren\\'s books\\nWorking with illustrator Laura Cornell, Curtis has written a number of children\\'s books, all published by HarperCollins Children\\'s Books.\\nWhen I Was Little: A Four-Year Old\\'s Memoir of Her Youth, 1993.\\nTell Me Again About The Night I was Born, 1996.\\nToday I Feel Silly, and Other Moods That Make My Day, 1998; listed on the New York Times best-seller list for 10 weeks.\\nWhere Do Balloons Go?: An Uplifting Mystery, 2000.\\nI\\'m Gonna Like Me: Letting Off a Little Self-Esteem, 2002.\\nIt\\'s Hard to Be Five: Learning How to Work My Control Panel, 2004.\\nIs There Really a Human Race?, 2006.\\nBig Words for Little People, ISBN 978-0-06-112759-5, 2008.\\nMy Friend Jay, 2009, edition of one, presented to Jay Leno\\nMy Mommy Hung the Moon: A Love Story, 2010.\\n\\nInvention\\nIn 1987, Curtis filed a US patent application that subsequently issued as Patent No. 4,753,647. This is a modification of a diaper with a moisture proof pocket containing wipes that can be taken out and used with one hand.

Her work falls into several categories, including ambient or space music. She is considered a pioneer in new age music best known for her album Novus Magnificat.\\n\\nBiography\\nEarly life\\nConstance Mary Demby was born in Oakland, California on May 9, 1939. She started playing classical piano at age 8 and by age 12 was performing concertos. Her family moved to Connecticut and Demby went on to found a jazz ensemble in high school, where she developed her skills as a improviser, and later became a multi-instrumentalist, taking up voice, hammered dulcimer, koto, ch\\'eng, harpeleck, tamboura, and later the synthesizer and her own handmade instruments.\\n\\nEast Coast and early career\\nDemby studied sculpture and painting at the University of Michigan, but interrupted this formal education In 1960 when she moved to New York City\\'s Greenwich Village. She continued to work as a musician and sculptor, combining these disciplines with her first sheet metal sound sculptures built in 1966. She had been torching a sheet of metal in her sculptural practice when she noticed the low tones and unusual sounds that the vibrating metal produced, which subsequently led to the development of her first handmade instruments. In 1967 Demby used these sculptures in a series of happening-style events at the Charles Street multimedia gallery A Fly Can\\'t Bird But a Bird Can Fly, owned by Robert Rutman. In one piece called \"The Thing\", Rutman wore a white cardboard box and banged on Demby\\'s sheet metal creation with \"a rock in a sock.\" In another piece entitled \"Space Mass\", Rutman projected film upon a piece of curved sheet metal onto which Demby had welded several steel rods that she played as a percussion instrument. Rutman later remarked, \"We thought it would sound good as a xylophone, but it didn\\'t.\"\\nDemby and Rutman moved to Maine, and in 1970 co-founded the Central Maine Power Music Company (CMPMC) with fellow. Ranging from 6 to 20 members at any given performance, the group had a rotating roster of guest artists that included hammer dulcimer player Dorothy Carter and video artist Bill Etra. The band toured the East Coast, playing at planetariums in Massachusetts, as well as Lincoln Center, the World Trade Center, and at the United Nations Sculpture Garden in New York City. Demby\\'s co-founder told a reporter in 1974:\\nIn 1976, the CMPMC disbanded and its founders moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts. While Rutman went on to pursue directions in contemporary classical and industrial music with the sheetmetal instruments that they had created, Demby headed down a quieter path. She studied yoga with Sant Ajaib Singh Ji and formed the table-and dulcimer duo Gandharva, which gigged at coffeehouses and on the street. She made her recording debut on Dorothy Carter\\'s debut album Troubadour. Demby\\'s first solo album Skies Above Skies comprised devotional prayers set to music made entirely by Demby on hammer dulcimer, ch\\'eng, tambura, synthesizer, cello, piano, organ, and voice reciting lines from sources as wide-ranging as the Bible to Hindi scripture to the Popol Vuh.\\n\\nCalifornia and recordings\\nDemby made her first pilgrimage to India in 1979. In 1980 she moved back to California, settling in Marin County just north of San Francisco. She founded the record label Sound Currents to release her second album Sunbourne, inspired by \"The Emerald Tablets\", an ancient script by Hermes Trismegistus. Her hammer dulcimer album Sacred Space Music followed on the seminal Hearts of Space Records ambient music label. Demby performed at The Alaron Center in Sausalito spawning her Live at Alaron album and the themes in her definitive studio album, Novus Magnificat.\\n\\nInstrument design\\nDemby continued to develop her experimental musical instruments, which she called the Whale Sail and the Space Bass. These 10-foot-long sheet metal idiophones are played with a bass bow to create low resonating tones. George Lucas\\' Skywalker Ranch licensed the sounds of the Space Bass for use in their film scores, and The Discovery Channel filmed the Space Bass in Gaudi\\'s Park Güell in Barcelona for one of their specials. The Space Bass is also featured on the soundtrack for the IMAX film, Chronos, directed by Ron Fricke.\\nThe International Space Sciences Organization commissioned Demby to create a score for the film I AM, and Demby\\'s album Spirit Trance features four selections from the film. Another song on the album, \"Legend\", was composed for Alan Hauge\\'s film James Dean – an American Legend, but due to complications with the James Dean Foundation it was shelved.\\nIn 2000 Demby moved to Spain where she composed the Gregorian chant-inspired Sanctum Sanctuorum. After returning to the U.S., Demby has toured the West Coast presenting concerts and healing workshops, and her Sound Currents label subsequently released Sonic Immersion, a vibrational sound healing attunement through use of the Space Bass.\\n\\nDiscography\\nStudio albums\\nSkies Above Skies (CS, Sound Currents / Gandarva, 1978)\\nSunborne (CS, Sound Currents/Gandarva, 1980)\\nSacred Space Music (CS, Sound Currents/Gandarva; Hearts of Space, 1982, 1988 CD)\\nNovus Magnificat: Through the Stargate (Hearts of Space, 1986)\\nSet Free (Hearts of Space, 1989)\\nAeterna (Hearts of Space, 1995)\\nThe Beloved (Living Essence Foundation, 1998)\\nThe Heart Meditation (Living Essence, 1998)\\nFaces of the Christ (Sound Currents, 2000)\\nSanctum Sanctuorum (Hearts of Space, 2001)\\nSpirit Trance (Hearts of Space, 2004)\\nSonic Immersion (Sound Currents, 2004)\\nAmbrosial Waves – Healing Waters (Sound Currents, 2011)\\nAmbrosial Waves – Tidal Pools (Sound Currents, 2011)\\nNovus Magnificat: Through the Stargate: 30th Anniversary Edition (Hearts of Space, 2017)\\n\\nLive albums\\nConstance Demby at Alaron (Sound Currents, 1984)\\nAttunement: Live in Concert (Sound Currents, 2000)\\nLive in Tokyo (CD-DVD/Sound Currents, 2003)\\n\\nCompilations\\nLight of This World (CS/CD, Sound Currents, 1987)\\nPolar Shift (Private Music)\\n\\nAs guest\\nDorothy Carter Troubadour (Celeste, 1976)\\n\\nTours\\nTokyo / Live in Tokyo\\nEgypt / The Pyramids, Kings Chamber\\nSpain / Barcelona, Sitges, Valencia, Esplugues\\nBrazil / Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo\\nCanary Islands /Underground Volcanic Cave performance\\nLos Angeles / Laserium Cyberstudios, Sacred Music Festival\\nMassachusetts / Strasbourg, Fitch & Haydn Planetariums\\nNYC / Museum of Modern Art, UN Sculpture Garden, Lincoln Center for the Arts\\n\\nAwards / Reviews\\nVoted --\"One of the 10 best albums of the decade\" – Pulse!

Born in Thurlow, Pennsylvania, she grew up in Baltimore.\\n\\nCareer\\nShe earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Goucher College in 1908, and a master\\'s degree in mathematics from Columbia University the following year. After teaching at Wisconsin, she decided to study civil engineering and studied at Cornell University. In 1920, she became only the second woman to obtain a Civil Engineering degree from Cornell. She was hired that year as a draftsman by the B & O Railroad to design bridges. The following year, the President of the railroad observed that, since half of the railway\\'s passengers were women, the task of engineering upgrades in service would best be handled by a female engineer. Dennis became the first \"service engineer\" when the B. & O. created the position. Engineering historian Kurt H. Debus described her as the first service engineer in America. She was also the first female member of the American Railway Engineering Association.\\n\\nInnovations\\nAmong the innovations that Ms. Dennis introduced on passenger trains were seats that could partially recline; stain-resistant upholstery in passenger cars; larger dressing rooms for women, supplied with free paper towels, liquid soap and drinking cups; ceiling lights that could be dimmed at night; individual window vents (which she patented) to allow passengers to bring in fresh air while trapping dust; and, later, air conditioned compartments. Other rail carriers followed suit in the years that followed, and buses and airlines in turn had to upgrade their level of comfort in order to compete with the railroads.\\n\\nWoman\\'s viewpoint\\n\"No matter how successful a business may seem to be,\" she said, \"it can gain even greater success if it gives consideration to the woman\\'s viewpoint.\" Although the changes were not enough to save the passenger rail industry in America, Ms. Dennis\\' unique perspective as a traveling woman with training as a technical engineer influenced the travel industry nationwide.\\n\\nSources\\nCurrent Biography 1941 yearbook, pp. 220–221\\nSybil E.

She is best known for developing the first waterproof disposable diaper, a feat which earned her election to the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2015.\\n\\nEarly life and education\\nDonovan was born in 1917 in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Her father, also an inventor, developed and ran the South Bend Lathe Works manufacturing plant along with her uncle in South Bend, Indiana. Her father and uncle had invented an industrial lathe that was used to grind both \"automobile gears and gun barrels.\"\\nDonovan received a B.A. in English from Rosemont College in Pennsylvania in 1939. In 1958, she earned a master\\'s degree in architecture from Yale University, where she was one of only three women in her graduating class.\\nDonovan had stints as an editor at both Harper\\'s Bazaar and Vogue magazine. She eventually quit working to focus on her family life. Donovan was first married to James F. Donovan and later to John F. Butler and had two children.\\n\\nInventions\\nAfter World War II, unhappy with the thankless and repetitive task of changing her daughter\\'s cloth diapers, along with the mess the soiled diaper made to the surrounding bedsheets and her daughter\\'s clothing, she came up with a possible solution. With the use of a sewing machine and a shower curtain, she succeeded in developing what is considered the first waterproof diaper cover. Not only did this new diaper keep the bed and clothing from becoming wet or soiled, but it also did not cause chafing or diaper rash.\\nDonovan was granted four patents for her diaper cover, including the use of plastic snaps as opposed to safety pins. In 1949, she attempted to sell what she called the \"boater\" to a number of different manufacturers; the effort was, at first, largely unsuccessful. She later started selling the waterproof diaper at Saks Fifth Avenue. Two years later her company and patents were sold for $1,000,000 to the Keko Corporation. $9.5MM in 2018 \\nDonovan was granted 20 patents from 1951 to 1996. These included woman-related essentials and other convenience items, such as a facial tissue box, storage container box, towel dispenser, hosiery clamp, envelope and writing sheet combination, closet organizer, and dental flossing products. In 1985, she invented the product DentaLoop, a two-ply dental floss that eliminated the need to wrap the dental floss around one\\'s finger for use.\\n\\nLater life and death\\nDonovan died on November 4, 1998, at the age of 81 at Lenox Hill Hospital in the Manhattan section of New York City.\\nDonovan was featured on the March 15, 2018 episode of \"The Daily Show\".\\n\\nHonors and awards\\nDonovan was elected to the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2015 and has a picture on the Hall of Fame wall.\\n\\nSee also\\nVictor Mills\\n\\n\\n== References =='), (1064, ''), (1065, \"Ellen Eglin (1849- after 1890) was an African-American inventor who invented a clothes wringer for washing machines.\\n\\nPersonal\\nEllen Eglin was born in 1849 in Washington D.C. While living in D.C., Eglin made her living as a housekeeper and a government clerk.\\n\\nHer Invention\\nIn 1800s, she invented a special type of clothes-wringer which was a machine that had two rollers in a frame that was connected to a crank. Clothes would be fed in between the two rollers and as the crank was turned the clothes would have the water pressed out of them. A clothes wringer was made from two wooden pins that are on top of each other with a crank attached to allow the pins to roll. This invention came at a time when there were not a lot of ways to wash clothes other than with your hands. Therefore, this was an amazing invention and concept. However, Eglin decided to sell her patent to a “white person interested in manufacturing the product” for $18. In the April 1890 issue of Woman Inventor, Eglin was quoted as saying “You know I am black and if it was known that a Negro woman patented the invention, white ladies would not buy the wringer. I was afraid to be known because of my color in having it introduced into the market that is the only reason.” The buyer went on to reap considerable financial awards.\\n\\nLater Work\\nAfter selling her clothes-wringer she remained hopeful to patent a second device. She was funding this invention by herself and wanted a patent for it so that people could know that “the invention will be known as a black woman’s.” Despite wanting to exhibit the new model at the Women's International Industrial Inventors Congress, she never went on to patent it. In fact, there is no information that she ever created this invention. She went on to work as a clerk in a census office. Eglin was in a rare position as an inventor because she was one of only a few African American women inventors. She set the stage for later inventors such as Madam C.J. Walker, as well as Sarah Boone. Although Eglin invention became very successful, there is still a lack of sources on the events that took place in her life.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal sources\\nPatent of a Clothes Wringer from 1888\\nMagazine showcasing Ellen Eglin\"), (1066, 'Princess Elena of Montenegro, or more commonly known as Queen Elena of Italy (Serbo-Croatian: Jelena Petrović Njegoš; 8 January 1871 – 28 November 1952) was the daughter of King Nicholas I of Montenegro and his wife, Milena Vukotić. As wife of Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, she was Queen of Italy from 1900 until 1946 and Queen consort of the Albanians from 1939 until 1943.\\n\\nBiography\\nEarly life\\nShe was born in Cetinje as daughter of Montenegrin Prince and future King Nicholas I and his wife Milena. At the age of 10, she went to the Institute for young ladies in Saint Petersburg, Russia. She was talented at painting and architecture, and she designed the monument for Prince Danilo I.\\n\\nMarriage\\nAs the result of Elena\\'s marriage to King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy on 24 October 1896, she converted to Catholicism from Orthodoxy and became Queen of Italy when her husband acceded to the throne in 1900. Her mother was so distressed with the fact that Elena had changed her religion that she refused to come to the wedding ceremony in Rome.\\nDue to the Fascist conquest of Ethiopia in 1936 and Albania in 1939, Queen Elena briefly used the claimed titles of Empress of Ethiopia and Queen of Albania; both titles were dropped when her husband formally renounced them in 1943.\\nShe influenced her husband to lobby Benito Mussolini, Prime Minister of Italy, for creation of the independent Kingdom of Montenegro in 1941. In 1943 she subsequently obtained the release from a German prison of her nephew, Prince Michael of Montenegro, and his wife, Geneviève. Prince Michael had been imprisoned after refusing to become King of Montenegro under the protection of Italy.\\n\\nThe Queen and the wars\\nOn 29 July 1900, following his father\\'s assassination, Victor Emmanuel ascended the Italian throne. Officially, Elena assumed her husband\\'s whole titles: she became Queen of Italy, and with the birth of the Italian Colonial Empire she became Queen of Albania and Empress of Ethiopia.\\nOn 28 December 1908 Messina was hit by a disastrous earthquake. Queen Elena helped with the rescuers, as some photographs show. This helped to increase her popularity within the country. During the First World War Elena worked as a nurse and, with the help of the Queen Mother, she turned Quirinal Palace and Villa Margherita into hospitals. To raise funds, she invented the \"signed photograph\", which was sold at the charity desks. At the end of the war, she proposed to sell the crown treasures in order to pay the war debts.\\nElena was the first Inspector of the Voluntary Nurses for the Italian Red Cross from 1911 until 1921. She studied medicine and was able to obtain a laurea honoris causa. She financed charitable institutions for people with encephalitis, tuberculosis, former soldiers and poor mothers.\\nShe was deeply involved in her fight against disease, and she promoted many efforts for the training of doctors, and for research against poliomyelitis, Parkinson\\'s disease and cancer.\\nOn 15 April 1937 Pope Pius XII gave her the Golden Rose of Christianity, the most important honour for a Catholic lady at the time. Pope Pius XII, in a condolence telegram sent to her son Umberto II for the queen\\'s death, defined her a \"Lady of charitable work\".\\nIn 1939, three months after the German invasion of Poland and the declaration of war by the United Kingdom and France, Elena wrote a letter to the six European queens still neutral (Queen Alexandrine of Denmark, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg, Queen Elisabeth of Belgium, Queen Ioanna of Bulgaria and Queen Mother Maria of Yugoslavia) in order to avoid the great tragedy World War II would become.\\nOn 25 July 1943 Victor Emmanuel III had Benito Mussolini arrested. The king left Rome on 9 September to flee to Brindisi with the help of the Allies and Elena followed her husband in his escape. In contrast, on 23 September their daughter Mafalda was arrested by the Nazis and sent to Buchenwald concentration camp, where she died in 1944.\\n\\nExile and death\\nFollowing the war, on 9 May 1946, Victor Emmanuel III abdicated in favour of their son Umberto, and the former king assumed the title of Count of Pollenzo. On 2 June 1946 a referendum resulted in 52 percent of voters favouring an Italian republic over the monarchy. The republic was formally proclaimed four days later, and the House of Savoy\\'s reign over Italy formally ended on 12 June 1946. Elena and Victor Emmanuel III went to Egypt, where they were welcomed with great honor by King Faruk, but forced to live the rest of their lives in exile. Vittorio Emmanuel III died a year later of pulmonary congestion in Alexandria. Elena stayed in Egypt a short time before moving to France. There, in Montpellier, she was diagnosed with a severe form of cancer, and died while having surgery to treat it.\\n65 years after her death, on 15 December 2017, the remains of Elena were repatriated from Montpellier, to the sanctuary of Vicoforte, near Turin. The remains of Victor Emmanuel III were transferred two days later from Alexandria, and interred alongside hers.\\n\\nChildren\\nKing Victor Emmanuel III of Italy and Queen Elena had 5 children:\\nPrincess Yolanda Margherita Milena Elisabetta Romana Maria of Savoy (1900–1986), married to Giorgio Carlo Calvi, Count of Bergolo, (1888–1978);\\nPrincess Mafalda Maria Elisabetta Anna Romana of Savoy (1902–1944), married to Prince Philipp of Hesse (1896–1980) with issue;\\nPrince Umberto Nicola Tommaso Giovanni Maria of Savoy, Prince of Piedmont, later Umberto II, King of Italy (1904–1983) married Princess Marie José of Belgium (1906-2001), with issue.\\nPrincess Giovanna Elisabetta Antonia Romana Maria of Savoy (1907–1999), married to Boris III, King of Bulgaria (1894-1943), with issue;\\nPrincess Maria Francesca Anna Romana of Savoy (1914–2001), who married Prince Luigi of Bourbon-Parma (1899–1967), with issue.\\n\\nArms and monogram\\nTitles and styles\\n8 January 1871 – 24 October 1896: Her Highness Princess Elena of Montenegro.\\n24 October 1896 – 29 July 1900: Her Royal Highness The Princess of Naples.\\n29 July 1900 – 9 May 1946: Her Majesty The Queen of Italy.\\n9 May 1936 – 5 May 1941: Her Imperial Majesty The Empress of Ethiopia.\\n16 April 1939 – 8 September 1943: Her Majesty The Queen of the Albanians.\\n\\n9 May 1946 – 28 November 1952 Her Majesty Queen Elena, Countess of Pollenzo.\\n\\nHonours\\nNational honours\\nHouse of Petrović-Njegoš: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Prince Danilo I, Special Class\\n House of Savoy: Knight Grand Cordon of the Royal Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus  Vatican\\n Holy See: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Golden Spur\\n Holy See: Knight of the Decoration of Honour\\n\\n Sovereign Military Order of Malta: Knight Grand Cross of Justice of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, 1st Class\\n\\nForeign honours\\nAustrian Imperial and Royal Family: Dame of the Imperial and Royal Order of the Starry Cross, 1st Class\\n Bavarian Royal Family: Dame Grand Cross of the Royal Order of Theresa\\n Bulgarian Royal Family: Dame Grand Cross of the Royal Order of Merit\\n Iran: Dame Grand Cordon of the Order of Aftab\\n Spanish Royal Family: 945th Dame Grand Cross of the Royal Order of Queen Maria Luisa\\n Yugoslavian Royal Family: Dame Grand Cross of the Royal Order of St. Sava\\n\\nAward\\nHoly See: Recipient of the Golden Rose (twice)\\n\\nAncestry\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\n Media related to Elena of Montenegro at Wikimedia Commons\\nThe Njegoskij Fund Public Project : Private family archives-based digital documentary fund focused on history and culture of Royal Montenegro.\\nCrnogorska princeza Jelena\\n\\n[[Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism from E astern Orthodoxy]]'), (1067, 'Gertrude Belle Elion (January 23, 1918 – February 21, 1999) was an American biochemist and pharmacologist, who shared the 1988 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with George H. Hitchings and Sir James Black. Working alone as well as with Hitchings and Black, Elion developed a multitude of new drugs, using innovative research methods that would later lead to the development of the AIDS drug AZT. She developed the first immunosuppressive drug, azathioprine, used for organ transplants. She also developed the first successful antiviral drug, acyclovir (ACV), for the treatment of Herpes infection.\\n\\nEarly life and education\\nElion was born in New York City on January 23, 1918, to parents Robert Elion, a Lithuanian Jewish immigrant and a dentist, and Bertha Cohen, a Polish immigrant. Her family lost their wealth after the Wall Street Crash of 1929. When she was 15, her grandfather died of cancer, instilling in her a desire to do all she could to try and cure the disease. She graduated from Hunter College in 1937 with a degree in chemistry and New York University (M.Sc.) in 1941, while working as a high school teacher during day time. Her fifteen fellowship applications were turned down due to gender bias at the time, so she enrolled in a secretarial school, which lasted six weeks before she found a job.\\nUnable to obtain a graduate research position, she worked as a food quality supervisor at A&P supermarkets, and for a food lab in New York, testing the acidity of pickles and the color of egg yolk going into mayonnaise. Later, she left to work as an assistant to George H. Hitchings at the Burroughs-Wellcome pharmaceutical company in Tuckahoe, New York (now GlaxoSmithKline). Hitchings was using a new way of developing drugs, by imitating natural compounds instead of through trial and error. He believed that if he could trick cancer cells into accepting artificial compounds for growth, they could be destroyed without also destroying normal cells. She began to work with purines, and in 1950, she developed the anti-cancer drugs tioguanine and 6-MP.\\nShe began to go to night school at New York University Tandon School of Engineering (then Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute), but after several years of long range commuting, she was informed that she would no longer be able to continue her doctorate on a part-time basis, but would need to give up her job and go to school full-time. Elion made what was then a critical decision in her life, to stay with her job and give up the pursuit of a doctorate. She never obtained a formal Ph.D., but was later awarded an honorary Ph.D from New York University Tandon School of Engineering (then Polytechnic University of New York) in 1989 and honorary SD degree from Harvard university in 1998.\\n\\nCareer and research\\nElion had also worked for the National Cancer Institute, American Association for Cancer Research and World Health Organization, among other organizations. From 1967 to 1983, she was the Head of the Department of Experimental Therapy for Burroughs Wellcome.\\nShe was affiliated with Duke University as Adjunct Professor of Pharmacology and of Experimental Medicine from 1971 to 1983 and Research Professor from 1983 to 1999.\\nRather than relying on trial-and-error, Elion and Hitchings used the differences in biochemistry between normal human cells and pathogens (disease-causing agents such as cancer cells, protozoa, bacteria, and viruses) to design drugs that could kill or inhibit the reproduction of particular pathogens without harming the host cells. The drugs they developed are used to treat a variety of maladies, such as leukemia, malaria, organ transplant rejection (azathioprine), as well as herpes (acyclovir, which was the first selective and effective drug of its kind). Most of Elion\\'s early work came from the use and development of purines. Elion\\'s inventions include:\\n\\nDuring 1967 she occupied the position of the head of the company\\'s Department of Experimental Therapy and officially retired in 1983. Despite her retirement, Elion continued working almost full-time at the lab, and oversaw the adaptation of azidothymidine (AZT), which became the first drug used for treatment of AIDS.\\n\\nAwards and honors\\nIn 1988 Elion received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, together with Hitchings and Sir James Black for discoveries of \"important new principles of drug treatment\". She was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1990, a member of the Institute of Medicine in 1991 and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences also in 1991.\\nAwards include the Garvan-Olin Medal (1968), the National Medal of Science (1991), and the Lemelson-MIT Lifetime Achievement Award (1997). In 1991 Elion became the first woman to be inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In 1992, she was elected to the Engineering and Science Hall of Fame. She was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1995.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nSoon after graduating from Hunter College, Elion met Leonard Canter, an outstanding statistics student at City College of New York (CCNY). They planned to marry, but Leonard became ill. On June 25, 1941 he died from bacterial endocarditis, an infection of his heart valves.\\nElion never married or had children. She listed her hobbies as photography, travel and listening to music. After Burroughs Wellcome moved to Research Triangle Park in North Carolina, Elion moved to nearby Chapel Hill. Gertrude Elion died in North Carolina in 1999, aged 81.\\n\\nReferences\\nFurther reading\\nMacBain, Jenny (2004). Gertrude Elion : Nobel prize winner in physiology and medicine (1st ed.). Rosen Pub.

She gained fame in 2004 for creating a complete Commodore 64 system on a chip housed within a joystick, called C64 Direct-to-TV. That \"computer in a joystick\" could run 30 video games from the early 1980\\'s, and at peak, sold over 70,000 units in a single day via the QVC shopping channel.\\nEllsworth co-founded CastAR (formerly Technical Illusions) in 2013 and stayed with the company until it shut down on June 26, 2017. In late 2014, she moved from Seattle to Mountain View, California with the CastAR team.\\n\\nBiography\\nEllsworth was born in Georgia and grew up in the towns of Dallas, Oregon and Yamhill, Oregon, where she was raised by her father, a local Mobil service station owner. As a child, she persuaded her father to let her use a Commodore 64 computer which had been originally purchased for her brother. She taught herself to program by reading the C64\\'s manuals. While at high school, she drove dirt-track race cars with her father, and then began designing new models in his workshop, eventually selling her own custom race cars. This allowed her to drop out of high school to continue the business.\\nIn 1995, at the age of 21, she decided that she wanted to get away from the race car business, and she and a friend started a business selling PCs based around the Intel 486 microprocessor, assembling and selling computers. When she and her partner later had a disagreement, Ellsworth opened a separate business in competition. This new business became a chain of four stores, \"Computers Made Easy\", selling computer equipment in towns in Oregon. She ran that chain until selling it in 2000, at which point she moved to Walla Walla, Washington and attended Walla Walla College, studying circuit design for about a year. She dropped out due to a \"cultural mismatch\"; Ellsworth said that questioning professors\\' answers was frowned upon.\\n\\nIn 2000, Ellsworth attended her first Commodore exposition, where she unveiled a prototype video expansion for the C64. This project later evolved to become the CommodoreOne, a.k.a. the C-One, and C64-DTV, and a video on YouTube \"Expo Jeri 1st\". Ellsworth then began designing computer circuits that mimicked the behavior of her first computer, the Commodore 64. In 2002, she designed the chip used in the C-One as an enhanced Commodore 64 which could also emulate other home computers of the early 1980s, including the VIC-20 and Sinclair ZX81. She and her fellow developer displayed the C-One at a technology conference, which led to Ellsworth receiving a job offer from Mammoth Toys, which hired her to design the \"computer in a chip\" for the Commodore-emulating joystick. She began the project in June 2004 and had the project ready to ship by that Christmas. It sold over a half-million units, in the USA, Europe, and elsewhere.\\n\\nFrom December 2008 until March 2009, Ellsworth hosted a weekly webcast, Fatman and Circuit Girl, together with George Sanger. On May 30, 2009, Ellsworth demonstrated her Home Chip Lab at Maker Faire Bay Area 2009. Ellsworth was named \"MacGyver of the Day\" on February 25, 2010 by Lifehacker.\\nOn December 3, 2010 she released information on how to build a TSA \"naked\" scanner using repurposed satellite antenna parts. Ellsworth has published numerous technical articles online regarding subjects as diverse as homemade semiconductors (2009), homemade electroluminescent (EL) displays (2010), EL phosphor manufacture from common ingredients and ways to make transparent EL backplanes and phosphor without using expensive indium-tin-oxide coated glass and hard to obtain chemicals.\\nEllsworth was a keynote speaker at the Embedded Systems Conference on May 5, 2011. Ellsworth has made significant contributions to ongoing work on DIY transistors in relation to rapid prototyping as well as thick film fabrication of EL displays using off the shelf chemicals. In early 2012 Ellsworth and several other notable hardware hackers were hired by Valve Corporation to work on gaming hardware. Along with several other Valve employees, Ellsworth was dismissed the following year.\\nOn May 18, 2013, Ellsworth announced that she had developed an augmented reality development system named castAR with fellow ex-Valve engineer Rick Johnson, with the blessing of Valve\\'s Gabe Newell and would be funding it via Kickstarter later in the year. Her start-up company, Technical Illusions, is developing castAR.\\nEllsworth later revealed she had been secretly working to make castAR have \"true VR and true AR\" in addition to the previously announced projected AR capabilities. The castAR Kickstarter, launched on October 14, 2013, reached its goal of $400,000 in 56 hours and finished with $1.05 million, 263% of the original goal.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nEllsworth is a pinball aficionado and owns over 80 pinball machines.

Her extensive studies of the female anatomy helped her improve the digital style tampon.\\n\\nThe o.b. tampon\\nTampon commercials have advertised, “created by female gynecologists” for years but these gynecologists had always stayed anonymous. Women have invented tampon and sanitary napkins for years, but it was not until 1936 when Dr. Esser-Mittag created the new design to the age-old product which resulted in a digital tampon, known as an o.b. tampon. A digital tampon means that it can be applied using one\\'s digits, or fingers. The o.b. tampon consists of rolled fiber-pad layers that supposedly expands uniformly from all sides, filling the vaginal cavity more completely than a less flexible tampon. It is more efficient in guarding against leaks. Cotton and rayon layers achieve the necessary absorbency.\\nThe initials o.b. come from the German words \"ohne binde\", translating to without sanitary pad. The alteration to the tampon included that the tampon could be placed without the use of an applicator. A tampon without an applicator is beneficial to the user by means that it is easy to use, comfortable, and ultimately provided excellent protection for the user. Dr. Esser-Mittag\\'s idea was to create a product that worked with a woman\\'s body to offer the best protection. As an active swimmer she was dissatisfied with the options available for menstrual hygiene; and as a gynecologist she was in a position to take the initiative to find a better option for menstruating women. She was not satisfied with pads because they could not be worn in water, and she thought that applicator-tampons were uncomfortable and did not conform to the woman\\'s body. The o.b. tampon is much smaller than an applicator-tampon, and it is easy to insert, comfortable, and provides great protection.\\n\\nLater developments\\nAfter the invention of this new tampon, the product was mass-produced throughout the mid 20th century with the help of the Carl Hahn Company in Germany. This company, as well as the idea for the digital o.b. tampon, was later sold and eventually bought by Johnson and Johnson in 1974. In 1984, an advertisement for o.b. tampons aired on American television with the inventor Dr. Esser-Mittag. The o.b. tampon now comes in three sizes and three absorbencies. To this day the o.b. brand continues to retain a board-certified gynecologist and research team to pursue Esser-Mittag\\'s vision for innovative options for women. This idea for an o.b. tampon is still widely used across several different companies.\\nApplicator tampons – inserted into the vaginal cavity with a plastic or cardboard applicator tube – were invented in the United States by Earle Haas in the late 1940s. Applicators make it easier for some women to inject the tampon into position in the vagina. But by creating a tampon without an applicator Esser-Mittag created a more environmentally friendly product. 90% of raw materials used for o.b. tampons come from renewable resources. So not only are the tampons are environmentally friendly because they lack the applicator, but they are also made of environmentally friendly materials.\\n\\n\\n== References =='), (1071, ''), (1072, 'Fannie Schutz Spitz (February 14, 1873 — October 17, 1943) was an American inventor.

Marcus and Harriett established a school at the new town of Silverton and for a time had the author Mary Gilmore as their assistant. They then moved into Broken Hill and established St Peter\\'s School, where Myra was educated. Harriett Welsh was particularly esteemed as a music teacher. Farrell\\'s brothers remained in Broken Hill, while her sisters married and moved to Sydney and Perth.\\n\\nInventions\\nMethod of working\\nFarrell\\'s earliest ideas for practical inventions came to her as a child when at the age of ten she came up with the idea of a self-locking safety pin. She later described her lifelong method of working for a newspaper interview. Farrell would perceive a need for a particular product, would think about it, and sleep on it. Farrell claimed that in her dreams she would see the solution to the problem in great detail, including the way in which the object should be constructed. She would get out of bed and write down the details of construction, or the formula of a medication. She wrote on whatever was near to hand, including sometimes the bed-linen or the wall, and her somnambulant writing was always right to left, rather than left to right. In the morning, she would copy it out, with the aid of a mirror. She also drew all the detailed diagrams and created the models for submission for the patents process.\\n\\nPractical devices\\nFarrell\\'s first patent was for a tailoring device that enabled a small skirt pattern in a pattern book to be transferred directly to a piece of cloth. Her inventions included a number of practical household devices including a folding clothesline for use in flats.\\nHer physical aids included a boneless corset for sufferers of scoliosis, a brace for hernias and a device that effected a facelift by simple mechanical means. Farrell also developed a sling for carrying a baby, at a time when these were not in common use in Western countries. According to the author Ruth Park, this device promoted the comment from Americans that Australian mothers had learnt from kangaroos to carry their babies in pouches.\\nInventions for rural industry included an automated fruit picker and packer, and a device for sampling and weighing wheat. Farrell also invented the press-stud that can be attached to a garment without stitching, and the folding pram hood. By 1915 Farrell had 24 patented inventions.\\n\\nMedications\\nWhile living in Broken Hill, Farrell suffered acute respiratory problems. She dreamt of the formula of an inhalation of which the properties of the various ingredients had the effect of cutting mucous, reducing inflammation and promoting healing. She manufactured tablets to this formula, which were burnt in a clarifier and the fumes inhaled. Farrell then met William Taylor, a young man from Perthshire in Scotland, who had come to Australia suffering from tuberculosis. Farrell treated Taylor with her inhalant. He experienced a remarkable improvement, they were married in 1906, and he lived for another six years. Subsequently, the product was marketed as \"Membrosus\". Farrell also had great success with an ointment, known as \"Myra\\'s ointment\", with which she successfully treated a women who contacted her, suffering from a rare fungal disease of the skin.\\n\\nMilitary aids\\nDuring World War I Farrell worked on the invention of a barricade that could repel ammunition and lessen the impact of shells. The Australian Department of Defence took Farrell\\'s plans for investigation, but whether the barricade was developed and utilised was not acknowledged.\\nAt about the same time, she developed a light that could be projected to a great distance. She initially saw its use as being for advertising purposes, but the military also took the plans and Farrell\\'s prototype. The unconfirmed family legend is that the light was tested from the North Head of Sydney Harbour, causing confusion to the crew of a vessel out at sea who mistook the beam for that of the South Head lighthouse.\\n\\nPersonal\\nMyra Farrell, then Taylor, was described in an article in the Western Age:\\n\\n\"One would expect to find the person responsible for all this ingenious work to be rather difficult, but Mrs. Taylor is quite the reverse when one succeeds in making her talk of herself and her doings. Her manner is simple, kindly, and affable. In appearance she is essentially feminine, very fair, and plump, with appealing blue eyes, and brilliant colouring which comes and goes as she warms to her subject, and a soft, slow voice.\"\\n\\nFarrell married twice, firstly William Taylor with whom she had children Lavie Curtis Taylor and William Paterson Welsh Taylor, and secondly William George Farrell with whom she had a son, the violinist George Harry Welsh Farrell. After the death of her first husband in Adelaide, Farrell lived at various times in Western Australia and at Bondi in Sydney, spending her later life in Mosman.\\nAside from her inventions, Myra was a keen painter. Having learnt from an artist who painted stage scenery, she had a broad Impressionist style using intense colours and with little mixing of the paint. All her known remaining works are small landscapes.\\nFarrell was known in Theosophical circles and subscribed to the building of a grandstand at Balmoral Beach to witness the arrival of Krishnamurti in Sydney. She financially supported the utopian William Lane in his enterprise to found an ideal colony in Paraguay. In this she argued at length with Mary Gilmore, who also supported William Lane but was scornful of Farrell\\'s religious ideology.\\nShe was regarded as an eccentric, even within the family. Her eccentricities included keeping the foot of an Egyptian mummy on the mantelpiece, where it gathered dust because the housemaid refused to touch it. It was thrown out with the garbage and was subject to a police investigation when it was discovered by the garbage collector.\\nFarrell died at her home at Mosman on 8 March 1957.\\n\\nAccolades\\nMyra Farrell was described in the Geraldton Guardian:\\n\\nWithout fear of contradiction it is quite safe to assert that Mrs Myra Taylor ….. is a genius in the highest sense of the word.\\n\\nThe Western Age, Dubbo:\\n\\n\"That trite phrase \"A prophet hath no glory in his own land\" was never so strikingly illustrated as in the case of Mrs. Myra Juliet Taylor. This remarkable little lady might justly claim to be the most versatile woman in the Commonwealth, yet she dwells in our midst unknown, almost in obscurity.\"\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nBroken Hill Family History Group'), (1074, 'Marga Faulstich (16 June 1915 – 1 February 1998) was a German glass chemist. She worked for Schott AG for 44 years. During this time, she worked on more than 300 types of optical glasses. Forty patents were registered in her name. She was the first woman executive at Schott AG.\\n\\nLife and work\\nMarga Faulstich was born in Weimar in 1915. She had two siblings. In 1922, the family moved to Jena, where Faulstich attended secondary school. After graduating from high school in 1935, she began training as a graduate assistant at Schott AG, one of the leading manufacturers of optical and technical specialty glasses in Europe. In her early years there, she worked on the development of thin films. The findings from the basic research performed then are still used in the manufacture of sunglasses, anti-reflective lenses, and glass facades.\\nA talented young woman, Faulstich quickly advanced in her career – from graduate assistant to technician, then to scientific assistant, and finally to scientist. Her fiancé died in the Second World War, and from then on, she focused only on her career. In 1942 she studied chemistry while continuing to work at Schott. She could not finish her studies because the situation changed after the Second World War. Jena belonged to the Soviet occupation zone; however, the most advanced glassmaking facility in the world was located in Jena and the Western Allies wanted to obtain and use this know-how. Therefore, 41 specialists and managers of Schott AG were brought to the western sector, including Marga Faulstich.\\nA new research laboratory was built in Landshut in 1949 for the people from Schott AG to continue their work. However, after the plant in Jena was expropriated in 1948 and the division of Germany was firmly established in 1949, it was decided that a new plant would be built in Mainz for the \"41 glassmakers\" of Schott AG.\\nThe new plant on the outskirts of Mainz Neustadt (\\'new town\\') was opened in 1952. Here Marga Faulstich continued working on research and development of new optical glasses, with a particular focus on lenses for microscopes and binoculars. In addition to her research, Faulstich managed a crucible melt.\\nMarga Faulstich received international recognition for the invention of the lightweight lens SF 64, for which she was honored in 1973. In 1979 she retired after working at Schott AG for 44 years. She spent the following years travelling to distant lands, but still gave lectures and presentations at glass conferences. She died on 1 February 1998 in Mainz, at age 82.\\nGoogle honored her in a doodle on its homepage on 16th June 2018.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n\"Von Jena nach Mainz – und zurück.

She and her two sisters, Joan and Jane, were introduced to chemistry by their high school teacher. The three sisters all went on to study chemistry at D\\'Youville College. Edith Flanigen graduated class president and valedictorian. Joan and Edith both went on to receive master\\'s degrees in chemistry at Syracuse University. Flanigen received an M.S. in inorganic physical chemistry in 1952.\\n\\nCareer\\nIn 1952, Edith Flanigen joined the Union Carbide company. Her job at first was the identification, purification and extraction of different silicone polymers. In 1956, she moved to the molecular sieves group. In 1973, she was the first woman at Union Carbide to be named corporate research fellow, and in 1986, senior corporate research fellow. She was moved to UOP (a joint venture between Union Carbide and Allied Signal) in 1988, where she was named senior research fellow. Flanigen was promoted to UOP Fellow in 1991. Edith Flanigen retired from UOP 1994. Following her career at UOP, and through at least 2004, Edith Flanigen remained active professionally, including as a consultant with UOP.\\nIn her 42-year career associated with Union Carbide, Edith Flanigen invented more than 200 different synthetic substances, authored or co-authored over 36 publications, and was awarded at least 109 patents.\\n\\nChemistry\\nIn 1956 Flanigen began working on molecular sieves. Molecular sieves are crystal compounds with molecular sized pores that can filter or separate very complex substances. Edith Flanigen is best known as the inventor of zeolite Y, a specific molecular sieve. Zeolite Y was a certain type of molecular sieve that could refine petroleum. Zeolite Y surpassed Zeolite X before it. When refining \"crude oil\", or petroleum, it must be separated into all of its different parts, or fractions. Gasoline is one of the many fractions that come from refining petroleum. Flanigen\\'s zeolites are used as catalysts, or a substance that enhances chemical reactions. Zeolite Y is a catalyst that enhances the amount of gasoline fractioned from petroleum, making refining petroleum safer and more productive.\\nIn addition to her work on molecular sieves, Flanigen also co-invented a synthetic emerald, which Union Carbide produced and sold for many years. The emeralds were used mainly in masers (predecessors to lasers) and were even used in jewelry for a time, in a line marketed as the \"Quintessa Collection.\"\\n\\nHonors and awards\\nFlanigen has been the recipient of many awards and honors. She was, for example, the first female recipient of the Perkin Medal in 1992. She was also inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2004.\\nIn 2014, the Edith Flanigen Award was created by the Collaborative Research Centre at Humboldt University of Berlin. The award is to be given annually to an outstanding female scientist at the early stage of her career. The first award was given to Natacha Krins for her work at the University of Paris.\\nIn 2012, Flanigen was named recipient of the National Medal of Technology and Innovation.

She was a pioneer in the development of the theory of discontinuous automatic control, which has found wide application in hysteresis control systems; such applications include guidance systems, electronics, fire-control systems, and temperature regulation. She became the first female engineering professor at Stanford University in 1961 and the first female engineer elected a Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.\\n\\nEarly life and education\\nLotz was born in Hamelin, Germany on 16 July 1903. She was encouraged at an early age to pursue technical subjects by her mother, whose family had been involved in construction for several generations. She often visited construction sites with her uncle and attended half-price matinee shows for technical films. After her father, Osark, a travelling journalist, was drafted for military service in World War I, the young Irmgard helped the family by becoming a math tutor while studying at a girls\\' Gymnasium in Hanover. Several years later, when Osark returned to Hanover he was in poor health and Irmgard continued to work to bring in extra money for the family. She graduated from the Gymnasium in 1923 and entered the University of Hanover to study mathematics and engineering. Later in life, she explained why she decided to study engineering:\\n\\nI wanted a life which would never be boring. That meant a life in which always new things would occur ... I wanted a career in which I would always be happy even if I were to remain unmarried.\\n\\nIn college she studied applied mathematics and fluid dynamics and was often the only woman in her classes. In 1927, she received her Diplom-Ingenieur and remained in Hanover for her doctorate. In 1929 she earned her doctorate in engineering, publishing her thesis on the mathematical theory of circular cylinders and heat conduction.\\nLotz went to work for the Aerodynamische Versuchsanstalt (AVA) in Göttingen, one of the most prominent aeronautical research institutions in Europe. She joined as a junior research engineer and worked closely with Ludwig Prandtl and Albert Betz, two of the leading German aerodynamicists of the time. Prior to her arrival at the AVA, Prandtl had been unsuccessfully working on solving a differential equation for his lifting-line theory for the spanwise lift distribution of an airplane wing. Lotz was able to overcome his difficulties and solve the equation, and additionally developed a relatively simple method for practical use. She published what is now known as the \"Lotz method\" in 1931 for calculating the lift on a three-dimensional wing, and it became a standard technique used internationally. Following this achievement, she was promoted to team leader and built the theoretical department at the AVA by establishing her own research program and assisting other research groups.\\nIn 1932, she met Wilhelm Flügge, who was a civil engineer and privatdozent at the University of Göttingen. As they prepared to marry, Lotz\\'s career progressed well and by the time they married in 1938 she had been appointed Head of the Department of Theoretical Aerodynamics. However, Flügge was branded \"politically unreliable\" and denied promotion at Göttingen for his anti-Nazi views. Flügge later recalled that while he was denied because of his political views, Lotz was \"blocked from any possibility of ever getting into a university career, just because of being a woman\". The escalation and increasing influence of Nazi policies on academia led to their departure from the AVA and they moved to the Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt (DVL) in Berlin where Flügge-Lotz (her married name) was a consultant in aerodynamics and flight dynamics and Flügge was appointed Chief of Structures Research. Although banned from academic positions due to Nazi policies, they were permitted to continue their research activities under the protection of Hermann Göring, who was more concerned with technical expertise than ideological purity.\\nAt DVL Flügge-Lotz began her career in automatic control theory and pioneered the theory of discontinuous control systems. These control systems, also known as \"on-off\" and \"bang-bang\" systems, have only two or three input settings and are simple to manufacture and very reliable in practical application. She was mainly interested in the implications these systems had for the development of simple automatic flight control equipment. However, the theory describing their performance needed to be developed before they could be reliably implemented in physical systems. Flügge-Lotz began developing the theory while at DVL, but wartime priorities limited her time for heavily theoretical projects so she focused mainly on aerodynamics during this time.\\n\\nMove to France\\nAs World War II progressed, Berlin was increasingly subject to bombing raids by the Allies. In the spring of 1944, the destruction of Berlin had progressed so far that Flügge-Lotz and Flügge moved with their departments to the small town Saulgau in the hills of southern Germany. After the end of the war, Saulgau was in the French zone of Allied-occupied Germany. The French relaunched their aeronautical research activity and were eager to hire German scientists, so in 1947 Flügge-Lotz and Flügge moved with many of their colleagues to Paris to join the Office National d\\'Etudes et de Recherches Aerospatiales (ONERA). Flügge-Lotz served as Chief of a research group in aerodynamics until 1948 and published papers in both automatic control theory and aerodynamics, in which she discussed the problems arising from the increased speed of aircraft.\\n\\nCareer at Stanford University\\nAlthough Flügge-Lotz and her husband were happy living in Paris, the positions they held there provided limited opportunity for advancement. They wrote to Stephen Timoshenko at Stanford University casually asking about working in the United States and in 1948, and both received offers to teach there. However, at the time Stanford held a university policy that husband and wife could not hold professional rank in the same department, and despite Flügge-Lotz\\'s reputation in research, she had to accept the relatively minor position of \"lecturer\" as her husband became professor.\\nDespite lacking of a professorial title, she immediately began accepting students for PhD dissertation research in aerodynamic theory, and in the spring of 1949, taught her first Stanford course in boundary layer theory. At Stanford, Flügge-Lotz conducted research in numerical methods to solve boundary layer problems in fluid dynamics, making pioneering contributions with finite difference methods and the use of computers. In 1951 she set up a weekly fluid mechanics seminar for first-year graduate students to provide a forum for discussing the latest ideas and developments.\\n\\nDiscontinuous automatic control theory\\nIn addition to fluid mechanics, Flügge-Lotz returned to her work on automatic control theory initially started at DVL. She developed new courses and began advising student theses on the subject. She published the first textbook on discontinuous automatic control in 1953. A reviewer of her textbook wrote that:\\n\\nIn the simplest case a discontinuous automatic control system is a control system in which the correcting force is a positive constant A, or the corresponding negative constant -A, depending upon whether the sign of the error is positive or negative. Because of their simplicity, such systems are widely used, and the literature contains discussions of many particular systems of this kind. The present book represents the first attempt to treat such systems in a comprehensive and general way. ... the book constitutes a highly valuable contribution to the subject of automatic control, and it will, undoubtedly, lead to many further advances in the field.\\n\\nSince automatic control devices often found application in electronics, she also began collaborating with faculty and students in the Department of Electrical Engineering. Over time, her primary research efforts went increasingly into control theory, and in 1968, the year of her retirement, she published her second book, Discontinuous and Optimal Control.\\n\\nTenure\\nBy the mid-1950s, it became evident that Flügge-Lotz was performing all the duties of a full Professor but without official recognition. In fact, it was hard for students to understand why she was a Lecturer rather than a Professor, or even what the difference meant. The disparity of her status as a Lecturer became more apparent when she was the only female delegate from the United States at the first Congress of the International Federation of Automatic Control in Moscow. To address the issue before school opened for the fall quarter, she was appointed a full Professor in both Engineering Mechanics and in Aeronautics and Astronautics in 1961.\\n\\nLegacy\\nFlügge-Lotz retired in 1968 at age 65, but continued to conduct research on satellite control systems, heat transfer, and high-speed vehicle drag. During her lifetime, she received many honors for her work. In 1970, she was elected a Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) and chosen to give the von Kármán lecture to the AIAA in 1971. She received the Achievement Award by the Society of Women Engineers in 1970, and received an honorary doctorate from the University of Maryland in 1973. The citation for her honorary degree stated:\\n\\nProfessor Flügge-Lotz has acted in a central role in the development of the aircraft industry in the Western world. Her contributions have spanned a lifetime during which she demonstrate, in a field dominated by men, the value and quality of a woman\\'s intuitive approach in searching for and discovering solutions to complex engineering problems. Her work manifests unusual personal dedication and native intelligence.\\n\\nShe was also a senior member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), a member of Sigma Xi, and a member of the advisory boards of several scientific journals.\\nIn honor of her contributions, the “Wilhelm Flügge and Irmgard Flügge-Lotz Memorial Award\" was established by the Applied Mechanics Devision at Stanford University for outstanding graduate students.\\n\\nDeath\\nFlügge-Lotz\\'s health deteriorated after her retirement and she suffered increasingly severe pain from arthritis that spread over her body. On May 22, 1974, Flügge-Lotz died in Stanford Hospital after a long illness.\\n\\nWorks\\nDie Erwärmung des Stempels beim Stauchvorgang, Dissertation TH Hannover 1929\\nDiscontinuous Automatic Control, Princeton University Press 1953\\nDiscontinuous and Optimal Control, McGraw Hill 1968\\n\\nBibliography\\nJ.

She received a B.A. in chemistry from The College of Wooster in 1944 and an M.A. in management from Central Michigan University in 1978. In 1947 she married Alfred Free, a fellow researcher in urinalysis. She is most known for her creation of many self-testing systems for diabetes while working at Miles Laboratories, which is now Ascensia Diabetes Care. She currently is an Adjunct Professor of Management at Indiana University South Bend, and a Consultant for Bayer AG.\\n\\nBiography\\nEarly life\\nHelen Murray was born on February 20, 1923. She was the daughter of James S. Murray, a coal company salesman, and Daisy Piper Murray, who died during an influenza epidemic when Helen was six.\\n\\nEducation\\nHelen received her early education from the public schools in Youngstown, Ohio, and graduated in 1941 as the valedictorian of Poland Seminary High School. While attending a summer camp at the College of Wooster, Helen set her heart on attending Wooster. Greatly influenced by her high school English teacher, she originally intended to major in English and Latin in hopes of becoming a teacher; however, these plans soon changed. In December 1941 when Pearl Harbor was bombed, many young men either enlisted or were drafted into the army. Because of this, women were encouraged to pursue careers in science, so Helen switched her major to chemistry in which she received her B.S. in 1944. She has said that her switch to chemistry was the “most terrific thing” that ever happened to her.\\n\\nCareer\\nAfter graduating from Wooster, Helen immediately began working as a quality control chemist for Miles Laboratories (known as the creators of Alka-Seltzer); however, she aspired to be a researcher as opposed to working in quality control. When Alfred Free had a position open in his biochemistry research group, she interviewed and filled the position. They would marry in 1947 and have six children.\\nOriginally they researched different antibiotics before they moved on to dry reagent systems. They refined the Clinitest, a tablet that measured glucose levels in the urine of diabetic patients, and developed the Acetest, another tablet test for diabetes.\\nLater, Free worked with her husband to move the tests from tablets to strips, introducing Clinistix (the famous “dip-and-read” test) in 1956. It was the first dip-and-read diagnostic test strip for monitoring glucose in urine. Several other testing strips were developed and added to the market, including Uristix, Ketostix, Dextrostox, Labstix, and a still-current product, Multistix. These products are still used today.\\nIn 1969, Free moved into the Growth and Development Department, and she eventually became the director of Specialty Test Systems in 1976. She was Director of Marketing Services for the Research Products Division when Bayer Diagnostics acquired Miles in 1978.\\nShe also earned an MA in Management (Health Care Administration) from Central Michigan University (1978), and is an Adjunct Professor of Management at Indiana University South Bend.\\nBy 1975, Free had earned seven patents for her improvements in medical and clinical urinalysis testing.

She was also a graduate and educator, a business owner, a chef, and an author.\\nWakefield grew up in Easton, Massachusetts, and graduated from Oliver Ames High School in 1920. Wakefield was educated at Framingham State Normal School Department of Household Arts in 1924. There, she worked as a dietitian and lectured about foods. In 1928, she and her husband Kenneth Donald Wakefield (1897–1997) had a son, Kenneth Donald Wakefield Jr. In 1930, she and her husband bought a tourist lodge (the Toll House Inn) in the town of Whitman, Massachusetts in Plymouth County. Located about halfway between Boston and New Bedford, it was a place where passengers had historically paid a toll, changed horses and ate home-cooked meals. When the Wakefields opened their business, they named the establishment the Toll House Inn. Ruth cooked and served all the food\\nand soon gained local fame for her lobster dinners and desserts. The restaurant had many visitors, including Massachusetts\\' Senator John F. Kennedy. Her chocolate chip cookies soon became very popular. She invented chocolate chip cookies around 1938.\\nShe added chopped up bits from a Nestlé semi-sweet chocolate bar into a cookie. It is often incorrectly reported that the cookie was an accident, and that Wakefield expected the chocolate chunks to melt making chocolate cookies. In reality, Wakefield stated that she deliberately invented the cookie. She said, \"We had been serving a thin butterscotch nut cookie with ice cream. Everybody seemed to love it, but I was trying to give them something different. So I came up with Toll House cookie.\"\\nWakefield wrote a best selling cookbook, Toll House Tried and True Recipes, that went through 39 printings starting in 1930. The 1938 edition of the cookbook was the first to include the recipe for a chocolate chip cookie, the \"Toll House Chocolate Crunch Cookie\".\\nDuring WWII, US soldiers from Massachusetts who were stationed overseas shared the cookies they received in care packages from back home with soldiers from other parts of the US. Soon, hundreds of soldiers were writing home asking their families to send them some Toll House cookies, and Wakefield was soon inundated with letters from around the world requesting her recipe. Thus began the nationwide craze for the chocolate chip cookie.\\nAs the popularity of the Toll House Chocolate Crunch Cookie increased, the sales of Nestlé\\'s semi-sweet chocolate bars also spiked. Andrew Nestlé and Ruth Wakefield made a business arrangement: Wakefield gave Nestlé the right to use her cookie recipe and the Toll House name for one dollar and a lifetime supply of Nestlé chocolate. Nestlé began marketing chocolate chips to be used especially for cookies and printing the recipe for the Toll House Cookie on its package.\\nWakefield died on January 10, 1977 following a long illness in Jordan Hospital in Plymouth, Massachusetts.\\nIn 2018 the New York Times published a belated obituary for her.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nRuth Graves Wakefield at Find a Grave'), (1080, 'Ida Freund (15 April 1863 – 15 May 1914) was the first woman to be a university chemistry lecturer in the United Kingdom. She is known for her influence on science teaching, particularly the teaching of women and girls. She wrote two key chemistry textbooks and invented the idea of baking periodic table cupcakes, as well as inventing a gas measuring tube which was named after her.\\n\\nBiography\\nIda Freund was born in Austria. Following the death of her mother, she moved to live with her grandparents in Vienna. In 1881 her grandparents died and she moved to England to live with her uncle and guardian, the violinist Ludwig Straus well known as a member of the Joachim quartet and leader of the Halle Orchestra (1875–88). She enrolled at Girton College, achieving a first class honours in the Natural Sciences Tripos course despite having previously had only school level English language skills. She went on to Cambridge Training College for Women as a chemistry lecturer, and one year later joined Newnham College, Cambridge, as a demonstrator. In 1890, she was promoted to staff lecturer in chemistry (1893–1912). This was the first appointment of a woman as a full lecturer in the subject in the UK. She was an associate at Newnham College and then a member of its council.\\nHer focus on teaching left her little time for research, she did not pursue a master\\'s degree or a doctorate. She was responsible for the laboratory training of her students, many of whom came up to College with little or no knowledge of chemistry. Amongst her students she was thought to be an inspirational teacher and a singular character. She had lost a leg in a cycling accident when she was a girl and used variously walking sticks, a prosthetic leg and a three-wheeled tricycle wheelchair worked with her arms. Her disability and unconventional style of dress made her a distinctive figure which was much remarked upon at the time by colleagues and contemporaries.\\nFreund was an active feminist and supporter of women\\'s suffrage. She was amongst the women who fought for admission to the Chemical Society in the early 1900s. Women were eventually admitted to the Society in 1920, six years after her death. She remained at Newnham until her retirement due to ill-health in 1913. The chemistry lab at Newnham was closed following her retirement because by that time female students were admitted to study in departmental chemistry labs in the University. She died on 15 May 1914 following surgery at her home in Cambridge while working on her second book.\\n\\nPublications\\nFreund published one paper entitled \"The effect of temperature on the volume change accompanying neutralization in the case of a number of salts at different concentrations\" and two chemistry textbooks. The Study of Chemical Composition: An Account of its Method and Historical Development with Illustrative Quotations (1904) (reprinted in 2014.) and The Experimental Basis of Chemistry: Suggestions for a Series of Experiments Illustrative of the Fundamental Principles of Chemistry published posthumously in 1920. She had planned that the book should be 20 chapters but had only completed ten chapters at her death. The book was later edited for publication by colleagues and friends including Mary Beatrice Thomas, Director of Science Studies at Girton College.\\nIn the preface for the book, editors A. Hutchinson and Mary Beatrice Thomas suggest that in writing it: \"Miss Freund was attempting to bring to the notice of other teachers her views as to the manner in which students may be helped to realise that chemistry is a science based on experiment, and that logical interpretation of experiments leads directly to the generalisation known as the laws of chemistry.\"\\nBoth of Freund\\'s books are considered to be key texts in the teaching of chemistry and are much cited.\\n\\nTeaching\\nFreund is known for her interest in science education, and in particular for improving science teaching in girls\\' schools. At the time, in Cambridge, women could not work in the same laboratories as men so Freund taught special classes in the Chemistry labs at Newnham College. She also wrote text books and organised holiday workshops for women teachers. Freund experimented with different teaching techniques, favouring Wilhelm Ostwald\\'s approach, in which \"[t]he main facts of chemistry are dealt with in the form of a dialogue between a teacher and a pupil\". She insisted that her students read original research and test the validity of published work – a revolutionary approach for the time, for which she was criticised. However, she had a significant influence on the teaching techniques of the time and was much loved by her students\\nHutchinson and Thomas, the editors of her posthumously published textbook The Fundamental Principles of Chemistry, described her teaching ethos thus \"Miss Freund had a dread of thoughtless experimenting and slipshod thinking. She felt strongly that much that passes for training in science has little relation to scientific method and is of small educational value.\" They quote her as saying, \" I aimed at giving by means of class teaching not only a common ground of knowledge, but also a common standard concerning the nature of scientific proof and the meaning of real accuracy\".\\nShe opposed the introduction of domestic science teaching in girls\\' schools as a substitute for fundamental scientific education but made use of her own baking and culinary skills to create engaging teaching resources.\\n\\nPeriodic Table Cupcakes\\nFreund was the first person to bake a set of periodic table cupcakes. She used them as teaching aids in her classroom. She created boxes of chocolates with pictures of scientists and a large periodic table with each element represented by a cupcake decorated with its name and atomic number in icing.\\n\\nOne of her students described her approach:\\n\\nIn my year we were requested to go and make a further study of the \\'Periodic Table of the Elements.\\' We found a very large board with the Table set out. The divisions across and down were made with Edinburgh Rock, numbers were made of chocolate, and the elements were iced cakes each showing its name and atomic weight in icing. The nonvalent atoms were round, univalent had a protruding corner, bivalent two, trivalent triangular and so on. We divided it up between us!\\n\\nBased on her original idea, periodic table cupcakes have become a popular and fun way to celebrate chemistry at school bake sales and events aiming to promote public engagement with science. The Royal Society of Chemistry celebrated the launch of the Visual Elements Periodic Table with a set of periodic table cupcakes and students at Nottingham University did similarly for the birthday of Martyn Poliakoff. A video showing the collection of cakes is included in Professor Poliakoff\\'s series of online videos \\'Periodic Videos\\' Periodic Videos aim to bring chemistry to a new generation of students.\\nRecipe instructions for modern versions of Freund\\'s periodic table of cupcakes are available from a variety of sources online.\\n\\nInventions\\nAs well as inventing periodic table cupcakes, Freund also had a piece of laboratory apparatus (a gas measuring tube) named after her as her invention. The apparatus is no longer in common use.\\n\\nMemorials\\nIn April 1998 the lab at Newnham was restored as a memorial. The Ida Freund Memorial Fund was set up to raise the standard of women teachers in the physical sciences by giving them opportunities for further study. The Ida Freund Memorial Prize is offered by Newnham College. Furthermore, Girton College awards the Ida Freund Prize to its students of physical sciences for first class academic achievements.\\n\\n\\n== References =='), (1081, 'Frances Gabe (June 23, 1915 – December 26, 2016) was an American artist and inventor perhaps most well known for designing and building the Self-Cleaning House in Newberg, Oregon. She built her own model for $15,000 and it was estimated to go on the market in 1984 for about $50,000.\\n\\nLife\\nBorn in 1915 as Frances Grace Arnholtz on a ranch near Boise, Idaho, she was a self-proclaimed \"unusual\" person. She spent much of her time alone with her building contractor father, Frederick, and would accompany him on jobs. It wasn\\'t until after her divorce from Herbert Grant Bateson that she changed her surname to Gabe. The actual self-cleaning house was granted a patent from the U.S. government, along with 25 additional patents for individual inventions unique to the house totaling to 68 patents. Her psychiatrist once remarked, \"You\\'re many times over a genius. The world belongs to you, and don\\'t let anyone tell you anything different.\" She was once ridiculed for her invention but architects and builders now agree about it being \"functional and attractive\". The Self-Cleaning House fascinated Harvard University researchers and humorist Erma Bombeck who said she should be added to Mount Rushmore while Fred Amran, the professor of creativity at University of Minnesota, called her patent \"incredibly complex, the longest I\\'ve ever read\" and the Self-Cleaning House appeared on Ripley\\'s Believe It or Not!. The house was also displayed in 2002 and 2003 at The Women\\'s Museum in Dallas, Texas where it was a popular exhibit. She and the house were also featured in People magazine in 1982, and the house was also featured in The Guardian and The New York Times, as well as on Phil Donahue’s talk show and in several books, including Chuck Palahniuk’s Fugitives & Refugees (2003).\\nShe died on December 26, 2016 at the age of 101.\\n\\n\\n== References =='), (1082, 'Dame Pratibha Laxman Gai, Mrs Gai-Boyes  is a British microscopist and Professor and Chair of Electron Microscopy and Director at The York JEOL Nanocentre, Departments of Chemistry and Physics, University of York. She created the atomic-resolution environmental transmission electron microscope (ETEM) and is an outspoken advocate for women with careers in science.\\n\\nEducation and early life\\nGai grew up in India, and was fascinated by science as a child. She was influenced by Marie Curie, her education, and her parents to study chemistry. However, at that time, it was not socially acceptance for women to have careers in the physical sciences. When she was a teenager, she was selected as a national science talent search scholar.\\n\\n“It would have been very difficult without the scholarships because societal expectations for women at that time did not include careers in the sciences or chemistry. I would say that societal expectations, even today, as to what is good for women, including in the UK, do not always include scientific studies.\"\\n\\nGai was educated at the University of Cambridge where she was awarded a PhD in 1974 for research on weak beam electron microscopy conducted in the Cavendish Laboratory.\\n\\nResearch and career\\nGai has pioneered advanced in-situ electron microscopy applications in the chemical sciences. With Edward D. Boyes, she co-invented the atomic resolution environmental transmission electron microscope (ETEM), which enables the visualisation and analysis on the atomic scale of dynamic gas-catalyst reactions underpinning key chemical processes. Her research has helped to understand better how catalysts function, leading to valuable new science. Her microscope and process inventions are being exploited worldwide by microscope manufacturers, chemical companies and researchers.\\nIn 2009, after years of development, Gai, who holds a chair in electron microscopy and is co-director of the York JEOL Nanocentre at the University of York, succeeded in creating a microscope capable of perceiving chemical reactions at the atomic scale.\\nThis is an advance on conventional microscopes at this scale, which can only view innate material in the \"dead\" conditions of a vacuum at room temperature. It is known as the atomic resolution environmental transmission electron microscope (ETEM).\\nWith the help of colleagues, she built and refined the machine over two decades, beginning with a lower-resolution prototype when she was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford. She then spent 18 years in the US at chemical firm DuPont and the University of Delaware.\\nAlthough her microscope is highly valuable to the scientific field, she made the decision to not patent it, saying, \"I thought that if I patented it, no one else would be able to do work with it. I might earn some money, but I was not interested in that. I was interested in applications for many researchers, creating more fundamental science. So I decided not to patent it.\"\\nShe often advocates for women\\'s roles in science, and has spoken about the challenge of having children as a woman scientist. She says, \"what\\'s needed to keep women in science; it\\'s a very competitive field and they [otherwise] lag behind whether they are working or not.

A former national rollerskating champion and model in Australia, George began her acting career playing Angel Parrish on the Australian soap opera Home and Away from 1993 to 1996. After moving to the United States, George made her film debut in the neo-noir science fiction feature Dark City (1998) and later appeared in supporting roles in Steven Soderbergh\\'s crime film The Limey (1999) and David Lynch\\'s Mulholland Drive (2001).\\nShe also appeared in television, on series such as Friends (2003), Alias (2003–04), In Treatment (2008), Grey\\'s Anatomy (2008–09) and Lie to Me (2010), earning a nomination for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film for In Treatment. In 2005, George transitioned into leading roles in films, starring as Kathy Lutz in the remake of The Amityville Horror (2005), followed by the thriller Turistas (2006) and the vampire horror film 30 Days of Night (2007). She garnered critical acclaim for her starring role in Triangle (2009).\\nGeorge\\'s subsequent work includes the thriller A Lonely Place to Die (2011), the Australian drama series The Slap (2011), for which she won a Logie Award for Most Outstanding Actress, the British-American spy drama series Hunted (2012) and the drama series The Good Wife (2013–14). In 2015, she starred in the American adaptation of The Slap, playing the same character, Rosie, that she had played in the Australian version. She also played the lead role in the American medical drama series Heartbeat (2016).\\n\\nEarly life\\nGeorge was born on 6 August 1976 in Perth, Western Australia, to a \"middle class\" family, the daughter of Pamela, a nurse, and Glenn George, a construction worker. She is of Scottish descent. William Ward, a grandfather on her mother\\'s side, worked as a prison warden at Rottnest Island, offshore from Perth. The second of four children, she is also a cousin of the opera singer Taryn Fiebig.\\nGeorge attended Warwick Senior High School and developed an interest in dancing and began studying jazz, tap, ballet, and modern dance at the age of seven. Her enthusiasm for dance eventually evolved into a passion for artistic roller skating. She is an Australian national roller skating champion and won bronze medals in the National Championships in 1989 and 1990. She won a silver medal at the Junior World Championship in 1991.\\n\\nCareer\\n1992–1998: Early work\\nGeorge began modeling in her early teens, and in 1992 she was named Western Australia\\'s Teenage Model of the Year. At the age of sixteen, George and a friend, Cara Mitchinson, both acted in a mock episode of the popular Australian soap Home and Away with a video camera, playing Bobby and Sophie Simpson, respectively. When the offer of a role on the serial came, George\\'s parents convinced her to relocate from her native Perth to Sydney and she began lodging with families. George met with casting director Liz Mullinar and was subsequently cast in the role of Angel Parrish. She made her first on-screen appearance on 30 March 1993, arriving as a teenage runaway. While playing the role, George made property investments and wrote advice columns for two English teen magazines.\\nHer role earned her five consecutive Logie Award nominations, of which she won two. The character became popular among viewers when she was paired up with Shane Parrish, and to this day they remain one of the soap\\'s most loved couples. George departed Home and Away on 30 August 1996. She then made a health and fitness video, Mind, Body and Soul (1996), created a sleepwear line called \"An Angel at My Bedside\", and had a recurring role on the short-lived 1997 Fox Broadcasting Company television fantasy drama series Roar, which was filmed in Queensland, opposite Heath Ledger. Her fearlessness in performing the show\\'s stunts endeared her to the show\\'s creator, Shaun Cassidy, who subsequently cast her as the female lead in the pilot Hollyweird. A show about \"the adventures of an intrepid pair of friends from Ohio who take their love for the macabre and use it to solve crimes plaguing Los Angeles\", she was to star alongside Bodhi Elfman and Fab Filippo. The pilot was ordered to series, however, the Fox Network\\'s tinkering and delays frustrated Cassidy, who pulled out of the project, saying that Fox had forced him to spend \"much of the last year trying to fix something I never viewed as broken in the first place.\" Ultimately, production never went ahead on the show. George then appeared on the cover and in a nude pictorial for the March 1997 issue of Australian Playboy.\\nIn late 1997, George decided to relocate from Australia to the United States, hoping to establish a career in Hollywood. She recalled her first day arriving in Los Angeles: \"I saw Jennifer Jason Leigh in a parking garage, and [later] the same night, I went to a restaurant and I walked into the toilet and opened the door, and Courtney Love was sitting on the loo.\" Within a year after relocating, George made her film debut in the critically acclaimed neo-noir science fiction film Dark City (1998).\\n\\n1999–2008: Film breakthrough\\nAfter a supporting role in Steven Soderbergh\\'s 1999 neo-noir crime film The Limey, she was cast in a supporting role, Cleo Miller, in the 2001 black comedy Sugar & Spice and had a minor role in David Lynch\\'s critically acclaimed Mulholland Drive, which opened at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival. She starred in several unaired TV pilots, including the lead role in Lost in Oz, an original sequel to The Wizard of Oz, inspired by the Oz books of L. Frank Baum. After pilot was filmed, a significant amount of time passed before the decision was made to film a second episode. However, by then George\\'s contract had lapsed and, as she had just moved to America, she didn\\'t want to move back to Australia to shoot it. Ultimately, a second episode was never shot and the show was never picked up.\\nShe starred in the short-lived ABC drama-comedy Thieves, co-starring John Stamos. She starred in the sixth season premiere of the WB series Charmed, had a minor role opposite Renée Zellweger and Ewan McGregor in the 2003 romantic comedy Down with Love and was originally cast as Susan Freeman in the American series Coupling based on the British series of the same name. After \"an audition from hell\", George was cast and filmed the pilot, but the network (NBC) then fired the writers and replaced George and her fellow castmembers Breckin Meyer and Emily Rutherfurd with Rena Sofer, Colin Ferguson and Sonya Walger, respectively. The series lasted only four episodes and show creator Steven Moffat blamed NBC\\'s meddling as the reason for the show\\'s failure, saying that they \"fucked it up because they intervened endlessly.\" George later commented that she \"dodged a bullet\" by being replaced before the show aired.\\nIn 2003, she landed the role of Lauren Reed on the ABC television series Alias. She had auditioned to play lead character Sydney Bristow, but lost out to Jennifer Garner. When that happened, ABC cast her on Thieves instead. It was originally planned that George would guest-star for several episodes but she was quickly upgraded to regular. To explain her character\\'s accent (George is Australian), the writers wrote that she was born in the United States but grew up in London. George left the show at the end of the third season, saying that \"I got offered a couple of films so I decided to kind\\'ve [sic] move on.\"\\nHer first starring role in a feature film was Kathy Lutz in the 2005 remake of the 1979 horror film, The Amityville Horror. The film was not well received by critics, but was a major success at the worldwide box office, grossing over $108 million. Despite unfavorable reviews, Film Threat praised George and her co-star Ryan Reynolds\\'s performances, stating that they \"make a striking couple. Both young and extremely attractive\" and that she \"does an impeccable American accent, but otherwise she is unremarkable as Kathy Lutz. Her physical beauty is sometimes distracting, but not enough to keep the audience awed by her acting.\" That same year, she played Deanna Schine in the thriller Derailed, co-starring Clive Owen and Jennifer Aniston, playing the wife of a man embroiled in an affair.\\nIn March 2006, it was announced that she had been cast in the NBC comedy-drama series Lipstick Jungle, based on the novel of the same name by Candace Bushnell. George was to play Nico Reilly, the editor-in-chief of Bonfire Magazine. However, the show underwent significant changes with George and other castmates being replaced and with executive producers DeAnn Heline and Eileen Heisler, writers Rand Ravich and Jill Gordon and director Nigel Cole all fired. George had been personally cast by Bushnell, but left in early 2007 when she was offered the HBO series In Treatment. Also in 2006, she travelled to Brazil to film the horror-thriller Turistas (released in the UK and Ireland as Paradise Lost) with Josh Duhamel and Olivia Wilde. Shooting lasted three months on what was the first Hollywood film to be shot entirely on location in Brazil and George, who learned to speak Spanish and Portuguese for the role, said that the experience \"made me a better actress, more resilient, tougher.\"\\nIn 2007, she landed the lead role, Christine, in the biographical drama Music Within, opposite Ron Livingston, which focused on a disability rights activist in Portland, Oregon. The film had a limited release. In an interview, she said that she \"knew that Christine\\'s a true character, and the woman responsible for Richard Pimentel\\'s sort of success in a way. She was the driving force behind him and behind every good man is a good woman, and Christine was that woman.\" She starred in the British horror thriller WΔZ, and had a prominent role in the film adaptation of 30 Days of Night, directed by David Slade and co-starring Josh Hartnett. The film was a modest success with an over $75 million worldwide gross.\\n\\n2008–2018: Television and critical acclaim\\nGeorge returned to television in 2008 in the HBO half-hour drama In Treatment, co-starring Gabriel Byrne and Dianne Wiest, receiving a 2009 Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries, or Television Film, and also received a nomination for \"Best Actress\" at the 2009 Australian Film Institute Awards.\\nIn September 2008, George joined the cast of Grey\\'s Anatomy for eleven episodes as Sadie Harris, a bisexual intern, but in January 2009 it was released that she was leaving the show in a mutual agreement with the producers. Also in 2008, she starred in the film The Betrayed, which was released at the San Diego Film Festival, and was released direct-to-video in the United States on 30 June 2009.\\nOn 9 November 2009, it was announced that George would guest-star in at least two episodes of Fox\\'s Lie to Me playing Clara Musso. George also received the lead role in the Australian-British mystery thriller by Chris Smith titled Triangle, which opened to positive reviews. George also starred in the British thriller film A Lonely Place to Die (2010), directed by Julian Gilbey. She climbed Ben Nevis mountain for her role in the film, later telling The Sun: \"It was tough because it\\'s a pretty dangerous location, and it wasn\\'t fit for a large crew, but we did it, we made it... I was climbing with Di Gilbert who has climbed Everest many times so that was incredible. And when you get up there, it\\'s just a huge sense of achievement.\"\\nIn November 2010, George was named the new face of L\\'Oréal Melbourne Fashion Festival. In 2012, George appeared as Rosie in the Australian TV series The Slap and as Sam Hunter in the British TV series Hunted, which was filmed over seven months in London, Scotland and Morocco. An American adaptation of the series, in which George again played the character Rosie, premièred on the NBC network in February 2015. A review of the U.S. series in The New York Times noted George\\'s performance as \"particularly beguiling ... As Rosie she is absurd, infuriating, sad and very funny.\"\\nIn 2017, she was cast opposite Sean Penn in the television series The First (2018), created by Beau Willimon and filmed in New Orleans, Louisiana.\\n\\nOther ventures\\nGeorge is credited as the inventor of Style Snaps, a device intended to allow changing pant hem length without sewing. The product is marketed via direct response TV. She has stated that the invention earns her more money than her acting career.\\n\\nPublic image\\nIn November 2012, while promoting the television series Hunted for the Sun-Herald television magazine in Australia, George was quoted as saying: \"I don\\'t need credibility from my country any more, I just need them all to be quiet. If they have nothing intelligent to say, please don\\'t speak to me anymore. I\\'d rather be having a croissant and a little espresso in Paris or walking my French bulldog in New York City.\" The response was purportedly spurred by George being tired of repeated questions about her role as Angel Parrish on Home and Away – the role that had originally garnered her fame in Australia – as opposed to questions about her more recent projects. The publication of the article drew significant criticism, specifically from Australian publications. George would later claim that she was misquoted in the piece, and that the phrases had been \"swapped around and put out of context\": \"I never said that at all. We were laughing and I never said anything negative about my country,\" she contested.\\nIn light of a publicised domestic violence dispute between George and her partner Jean-David Blanc in 2016, journalist Christine Sams, who had originally published the Sun-Herald article, wrote a public apology, in which she noted: \"Many of those people attacking George have directly used those inane comments from my original interview (published years ago) to somehow justify her not receiving sympathy or help now. I just wanted to say sorry Melissa, you don\\'t deserve it.\"\\n\\nPersonal life\\nIn 1998, George met Chilean furniture designer and film director Claudio Dabed in Bali. They married two years later. In 2011, they announced their divorce. George then began dating hip hop mogul Russell Simmons.\\nIn 2011, George met French entrepreneur Jean David Blanc, the founder of AlloCiné, at a BAFTA awards party. Together they have two sons, Raphaël (b. 2014) and Solal (b. 2015). In September 2016, George separated from Blanc following allegations of domestic abuse which purportedly occurred at their home in Paris. George was hospitalised with head and neck injuries, and both Blanc and George received domestic assault charges over the incident, with Blanc claiming George instigated the confrontation. Blanc was ordered to pay George €1,000 in damages, and she, €1 to him.\\nShortly after the incident, George attempted to fly to the United States with the couple\\'s two sons for a work arrangement, but was prevented from doing so by French authorities after Blanc alleged she was attempting to kidnap their children. George denied this, and claimed she intended on returning to France with the children after finishing the work engagement.

She has over 1 million subscribers on her YouTube channel.\\n\\nBiography\\nGiertz has named the Disney cartoon character Gyro Gearloose as one of her earliest inspirations. She studied engineering physics in college but dropped out after a year. She started creating \"useless\" inventions after studying at Hyper Island in Stockholm, where she was inspired by the local open-source hardware community. Giertz\\'s interest in electronics began in 2013; she made a toothbrush helmet for a children\\'s show pilot episode on electronics, which was uploaded to YouTube after not being picked up, starting her YouTube career.\\nGiertz brands herself as \"the queen of shitty robots\" and runs a YouTube channel where she employs deadpan humor to demonstrate mechanical robots of her own creation to automate everyday tasks; despite working from a purely mechanical standpoint, they often fall short of practical usefulness, for comic effect. Giertz\\'s creations have included an alarm clock that slaps the user, a lipstick applier, and one that shampoos the user\\'s hair. When building her robots, Giertz does not aim to make something useful, instead coming up with excessive solutions to potentially automatable situations.\\nIn 2016, Giertz joined Tested.com, collaborating with Adam Savage on her first project, the Popcorn Feeding Helmet. In 2017, she hosted the comedy TV show Manick with Nisse Hallberg on Swedish TV6. The basic premise of the show is that the hosts invent funny creative solutions to everyday problems.\\n\\nFamily and personal life\\nAs of July 2016, Giertz lives in San Francisco.\\nThe Giertz family surname is of Low German origin. She is the daughter of Caroline Giertz, novelist and TV host, who Giertz describes as a \"ghostbuster\" due to her mother\\'s work on paranormal reality TV show Det Okända. Giertz is a descendant of Ericsson founder Lars Magnus Ericsson. Lutheran theologian and bishop Bo Giertz was her great-great-uncle.\\nAt the age of 16, Giertz spent a year in China as an exchange student. She stayed in Hefei, where she learned basic Mandarin.

She lived near Dunlop, a village in East Ayrshire, Scotland, lying between the village of Lugton and the town of Stewarton on the old turnpike road to Glasgow. Cheese made by her method became known as \"Dunlop cheese\".\\n\\nEarly life\\nBarbara Gilmour was a woman whose wits had been sharpened by her exile as a presbyterian in Ireland around 1660, during Scotland\\'s troubles between the Restoration of Charles II and the dirk & drublie dayis after the revolution. In Ireland she is thought to have learned the art of making whole milk cheese. She may have been in the Bantry Bay area, County Cork, where James Hamilton, 1st Viscount Claneboye was at one time based. Hamilton was a strong presbyterian adherent and son of Hans Hamilton the first Protestant minister of Dunlop Kirk. McMichael states that she was in County Down, Northern Ireland.\\n\\nIt is not known precisely where she came from, however \"Gilmore\" or \"Gilmour\" is a common local name, with for example a family of that name living in the Lands of Chapeltoun at around the start of the 18th century.\\nAnother source states that she was a pious young woman–a devout Covenanter–and, hearing of the martyrdom of Margaret Wilson (in 1684 or 1685) on Wigtown Sands, and being determined not to renounce the Covenant, she fled, like many others, from her home in Ayrshire to Ireland, and found employment in County Down, where she acquired a knowledge of the Irish process of cheese making. The persecution of females having abated after the horrible event of Wigtown Sands, Miss Gilmour returned to her home in Dunlop, and became a farmer’s wife.\\n\\nCareer\\nEventually, according to the Rev. Brisbane (1793), she returned to Dunlop, East Ayrshire, after the Revolution of 1688, bringing the recipe for the cheese with her; McMichael has it that she combined the best of Scottish and Irish cheese making methods to produce Dunlop cheese. Paterson records that she was the wife of John Dunlop, the farmer of Overhill Farm, now known as The Hill. Introducing a new style of cheese was not straightforward and, some of the locals adamant that cheese could not be made from whole milk, came close to accusing her of witchcraft which could have resulted in her being burned to death at the Cross of Irvine.\\nSome accused her of copying their recipes and indeed a farmer, Mr W. Aiton of Strathaven, pointed out that practical cheese makers were already aware of the benefit of adding cream to cheese before Barbara\\'s time, and in his opinion Dunlop cheese was so named from a trader who took these cheeses from the parish up to Glasgow. Others have cast doubt on the Irish origin of the recipe without disputing Barbara Gilmour\\'s introduction of Dunlop cheese.\\n\\nThe cheese presses\\nMost sources, e.g. Dobie state that \"Barbara\\'s Gilmours cheese press can still be seen today at The Hill\", however the cheese press here is dated 1760 and she died in 1732. The design of the press, with a heavy lintel stone having a screwed shaft passing through it attached to a frame, allowed the dead weight of the stone to be lowered onto the cheese progressively, improving the overall drainage of the whey and the firming up of the curd.\\nAnother stone at the farm may represent the remains a primitive cheese press. It is an expertly carved trough with various holes, grooves and three vertical sides. The groove running horizontally along the back may have helped support a wooden frame above the trough. It may have been re-used for a different purpose at a later date and is unlikely to have been part of the 1760 press.\\n\\nThe Hill cheese presses, 2007\\nThe Hill farm and the old road\\nThis farmstead, previously known as Over Dunlophill Montgomerie, has a U-shaped plan and has been little modernised since the 19th century, leaving evidence for earlier phases plainly visible. The farm buildings comprise a two-storied farmhouse flanked to the south by stables, a harness room and a forge and to the north by a byre and a dairy. A barn and a cart shed are in a detached range to the rear east of the main block and a small watermill is to the north, adjacent to the dairy. The farmstead is built of whinstone rubble and has slate roofs. It was visited by the RCAHMS in 1993. In the surrounding fields can be seen the earthworks of a rig, some of which is slightly reverse-S in plan. The farm buildings are notable, if not exceptional, for the numerous date stones and marriage stone incorporated into various parts of the buildings.\\nThe 17th-century road from Glasgow to Irvine ran past The Hill farm on the opposite side to the existing road, which is itself on the line of the 18th-century turnpike. The house used to face the other direction as can be seen by a slight asymmetry in the existing frontage and the old front door is now a just a window, but with tell-tale ornamentation on the lintel. The presence of the road as it was then, running past the farm, would have made the transport of her cheeses that much easier in those days of transport by pack animal or sledge. Timothy Pont\\'s map of Cunninghame (1604–1608) marks an \"O Hill\", emphasising the age of this settlement.\\n\\nGravestone and descendants\\nBarbara and John\\'s table style horizontal gravestone is now positioned as an upright against a wall of Dunlop kirk. It is very well preserved and as stated, gives the date 1732 for her demise. The gravestone inscription mentions children plural, however only a daughter, Mary, survived her parents, marrying Allan, son of Allan Brown of Gabroch-Hill. Their son, Andrew Brown, succeeded to Hill, and through his wife Jean Anderson, they afterwards succeeded to Craighead farm. Mary Dunlop, daughter of John Dunlop of Boarland and Jean Gilmour of Tailend, had the half of Boarland, died at The Hill, the property of her mother\\'s brother-in-law, in 1839. The Rev. Brisbane noted in 1793 that Barbara\\'s grandson was still living and was the proprietor at \\'The Hill.\\'\\n\\nDunlop cheese\\nBarbara successfully manufactured a species of cheese until then unknown in Scotland, being made from unskimmed milk from the famous Ayrshire cows. Her process was copied by her neighbours and Dunlop cheese came into such demand, that whether made by Barbara or her neighbours, or by the housewives of adjoining parishes, it found a ready market. It is suggested that the spread of the cheese to other districts was largely through farmers who had settled there from Dunlop parish.\\nShe was something of an evangelist in the matter of making \"sweet milk\" (unskimmed milk) cheese,and being a forthright and energetic character she traveled widely to teach the making of her Dunlop cheese, and so stimulated a nationwide demand. This demand stimulated merchants to visit Cunninghame, buy Dunlop cheese and sell it throughout the central lowlands of Scotland. Local cheese merchants from Kirktoun also bought up the cheese and took them to Glasgow for sale in the markets.\\nBarbara\\'s system for making Dunlop was widely copied and extended rapidly to many all parts of Scotland by the end of the 18th century, even where traditionally sheep\\'s milk cheese had been made. Nothing but skimmed milk had been used in the process of cheese making in this district, previously. All the cheese similarly made in the western counties received the appellation of \"Dunlop\" and in 1837 the Ayrshire Statistical Account records that 25,000 stones imperial were made in this parish annually.\\nThe high value which was set on the Barbara Gilmour cheese for the purpose of roasting was very much confined to Ayrshire, where a farl of oat cake or supple scone spread with roasted cheese, and a bowl of milk, or whey, or tea, or cold water, made a highly relished and substantial meal, precluding in many families the use of bacon for breakfast.\\n\\nCadgers\\nCadgers were the middlemen who toured the farms and bought the cheeses by direct negotiation, sending them to the markets in Glasgow, Edinburgh and other places. By 1837 some fourteen cadgers made a living in Dunlop Parish through buying and selling Dunlop cheese.\\nIn the long maturing stage Dunlop cheese loses very considerably in weight, which made dealers impatient to get it off their hands; and it was usually therefore retailed before it was ripe, and at an inferior price.\\n\\nA poem\\nAyrshire or Dunlop cattle\\nDunlop cattle are supposed to have originated here or within the parish, bred by J. Dunlop of that Ilk from improved stock from Holland, in around 1550 to 1700 or later. J. Dunlop of Titwood is said to have first bred \\'Ayrshire Cows\\' at one of his home farms. The breed, also known as Cunninghame or Ayrshire cattle are pied, white and brown, short in leg, long in the horn, straight in the back: the bulls are fiery in temper and the cows are peculiarly placid and docile. They produce milk which is very high in butterfat and ideal for cheese-making. The milk has a high protein content and is relatively homogenous.\\nIt is an interesting point to note that the selective breeding of cattle was almost impossible before the enclosure of land by dykes and ditches in the 18th-century, because prior to this the cattle were free to mix without much control from the farmer and establishing or maintaining a pure breed was therefore practically impossible.\\n\\nMicro history\\nThe British army and navy of this time purchased Barbara Gilmour\\'s Dunlop type of cheese as the taste of cheeses made from skimmed milk when compared with unskimmed cheeses was so unsatisfactory that it caused dissent amongst the regular troops and sailors.\\nIn the 17th century Dunlop had two fairs a year for the sale of dairy stock, one on the second Friday of May; and the other called Hallowday, on 12 November.\\n\\nAn Ayrshire cow was given to Robbie Burns in 1788 by Mr. J. Dunlop of Dunlop. He wrote to say that the gift was the finest quey in Ayrshire. A \\'quey\\' was the Scots for a heifer until she had birthed a calf.\\nIn Sir Walter Scott\\'s \"Heart Of Midlothian\" he has the Duke of Argyll saying \"the Dunlop is the very cheese of which I am so fond, and I will take it as the greatest favour you can do me to send one to Caroline Park. But remember, be on honour with it, Jeanie, and make it all yourself, for I am a real good judge.\"\\nTimothy Pont states of Stewarton and Dunlop in 1604 – 1608 that \"the butter of this countrey in effecte ferues a grate pairt of ye Kingdome, one aker of ground heir zeilding more butter then 3 akers of ground in aney adiacent countreys\".\\nOne place that Dunlop cheese is made today (2008) is at West Clerkland Farm, a short distance from Barbara Gilmour\\'s old home.\\n\\nThe Dunlop legacy of Barbara Gilmour\\nSee also\\nDalgarven Mill – The Ayrshire Museum of Country Life & Costume\\nCorsehill – A history of the area\\nDunlop cheese\\nLugton\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nA historical perspective, drawn from the Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland\\nA page on Dunlop Cheese\\nDetails of cheese making and a photograph of a stone cheese press at \\'The Hill\\' farm in Dunlop\\nA Researcher\\'s Guide to Local History terminology'), (1086, 'Olga D.

She was the mother of musician and producer Michael Nesmith of The Monkees.\\n\\nBiography\\nGraham was born Bette Clair McMurray, in Dallas, Texas, to Jesse McMurray, an automotive supply company manager, and Christine Duval. She was raised in San Antonio and graduated from Alamo Heights High School. She married Warren Audrey Nesmith (1919–1984) before he left to fight in World War II. While he was overseas she had a child (Robert Michael Nesmith, born December 30, 1942). After Warren Nesmith returned home, they divorced (1946). Her father died in the early 1950s, leaving some property in Dallas to Bette. She, her mother, Michael, and her sister Yvonne moved there. To support herself as a single mother, she worked as a secretary at Texas Bank and Trust. She eventually attained the position of the executive secretary, the highest position open at that time to women in the industry.\\nIt was difficult to erase mistakes made by early electric typewriters, which caused problems. In order to make extra money she used her talent painting holiday windows at the bank. She realized, as she said, \"with lettering, an artist never corrects by erasing, but always paints over the error. So I decided to use what artists use. I put some tempera water-based paint in a bottle and took my watercolor brush to the office. I used that to correct my mistakes.\"\\nGraham secretly used her white correction paint for five years, making some improvements with help from her son\\'s chemistry teacher at Thomas Jefferson High School in Dallas. Some bosses admonished her against using it, but coworkers frequently sought her \"paint out\". She eventually began marketing her typewriter correction fluid as \"Mistake Out\" in 1956. The name was later changed to Liquid Paper when she began her own company.\\nMistake Out started the 1960s operating at a small loss, with Nesmith\\'s home doubling as company headquarters. As the product became an indispensable tool of the secretarial trade, Nesmith relocated production and shipping from her kitchen to a 10 feet-by-26 feet portable metal structure in her backyard, where packaging, shipping, and production were centered.\\nBette Nesmith married Robert Graham in 1962; he joined her in running the company. They divorced in 1975.\\nShe sold Liquid Paper to the Gillette Corporation for USD $47.5 million in 1979.

Raised a Methodist, Graham converted to Christian Science in 1942, and this faith inspired the development of her corporate \"Statement of Policy\". Part-code of ethics, part-business philosophy, it covered everything from her belief in a \"Supreme Being\" to a focus on decentralized decision making and an emphasis on product quality over profit motive. She also believed that women could bring a more nurturing and humanistic quality to the male world of business, and did so herself by including a greenbelt with a fish pond, an employee library, and a childcare center in her new company headquarters in 1975.\\n\\nLegacy\\nHer only son, musician Michael Nesmith (best known as a member of The Monkees), inherited half of his mother\\'s estate of over $50 million.

She is one of the first individuals on the autism spectrum to publicly share insights from her personal experience of autism. She invented the \"hug box\" device to calm those on the autism spectrum. In the 2010 Time 100, an annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world, she was named in the \"Heroes\" category. She was the subject of the Emmy- and Golden Globe-winning semi-biographical film Temple Grandin.\\n\\nEarly life\\nFamily\\nTemple Grandin was born in Boston, Massachusetts, into a wealthy family. One of the Irish girls who worked for the family was also known as Mary, so Grandin was referred to as Mary Temple, soon shortened to simply Temple. Her mother is Anna Eustacia Purves (now Cutler), an actress, singer and granddaughter of the co-inventor for the autopilot aviation system (John Coleman Purves), with a degree in English from Harvard University. Her father was Richard McCurdy Grandin, a real estate agent and heir to the largest corporate wheat farm business in America at the time, Grandin Farms. Grandin\\'s parents divorced when she was 15, and her mother eventually went on to marry Ben Cutler, a renowned New York saxophonist, in 1965 (when Grandin was 18 years old). Her father Richard died in California in 1993. Grandin has three siblings: two sisters and a brother, with Grandin being the oldest. Grandin has described one of her sisters as being dyslexic. Her younger sister is an artist, her other sister a sculptor, and her brother a banker. John Livingston Grandin (Temple\\'s paternal great grandfather) and his brother William James Grandin, were French Huguenots who drilled for oil, intending to cut a deal with John D. Rockefeller, but the latter kept him waiting too long so he walked out before Rockefeller arrived. Then they went into banking and when Jay Cooke\\'s firm collapsed they got thousands of acres of undeveloped land in North Dakota as collateral. They set up wheat farming in the Red River Valley with dormitories for the workers; the town of Grandin, North Dakota, is named after John Livingston Grandin. Although raised in the Episcopal religion, Temple Grandin early on gave up on a belief in a personal deity or intention in favor of what she considers a more scientific idea of God.\\n\\nDiagnosis\\nContrary to widely published reports, Grandin was never formally diagnosed with autism in childhood or in youth. The only formal diagnosis received by Grandin was of \\'brain damage\\' at the age of 2, a finding corroborated subsequently when she was 64 years old, by cerebral imaging carried out in 2010 at the University of Utah. When Grandin was in her mid-teens, her mother chanced upon a checklist on autism published by Dr. Bernard Rimland, a renowned American psychologist and founder of the Autism Research Institute. Completing the checklist, Grandin\\'s mother hypothesised that Grandin\\'s symptoms were best explained by autism. A formal diagnosis consistent with being on the autistic spectrum was made only when Grandin was in her 40s. Grandin was later determined to be an autistic savant as well.\\n\\nEarly childhood\\nGrandin\\'s mother, Eustacia, took her to the world\\'s leading special needs researchers at the Boston Children\\'s Hospital, with the hope of unearthing an alternative to institutionalization. Having the financial resources to hire specialists to ensure her daughter was not institutionalized, Grandin\\'s mother eventually located a neurologist who suggested a trial of speech therapy. They soon hired a speech therapist, and Grandin received personalized input from the age of 2 and a half. A nanny was also hired when Grandin was aged 3 to play educational games for hours with her.\\nGrandin\\'s mother actively sought out and paid for private schools with sympathetic staff who were willing to work with her daughter\\'s special needs and thus, she started kindergarten in Dedham Country Day School. Her teachers and class strove to create an environment to accommodate Grandin\\'s needs and sensitivities.\\nGrandin considers herself fortunate to have had supportive mentors from elementary school onward. Even so, Grandin states that junior high and high school were the most unpleasant times of her life.\\nThe medical advice at the time for a diagnosis of autism was to recommend institutionalization, a measure that caused a bitter rift of opinion between Grandin\\'s parents. Her father was keen to follow this advice while her mother was strongly opposed to the idea.\\n\\nMiddle and high school\\nGrandin attended Beaver Country Day School from 7th to 9th grade. She was expelled at the age of 14 for throwing a book at a schoolmate who had taunted her. Grandin has described herself as the \"nerdy kid\" whom everyone ridiculed. She has described occasions when she walked down the hallways and her fellow students would taunt her by saying \"tape recorder\" because of her habit of repetitive speech. Grandin states, \"I could laugh about it now, but back then it really hurt.\"\\nThe year after her expulsion, Grandin\\'s parents divorced. Grandin\\'s mother remarried three years later to Ben Cutler, a renowned New York saxophonist. At 15, Grandin spent a summer on the Arizona ranch of Ben Cutler\\'s sister, Ann, and this would be a formative experience towards her subsequent career interest.\\nFollowing her expulsion from Beaver Country Day School (reports vary on the actual name of the school Grandin was expelled from, with Grandin herself noting it to be Cherry Falls Girls\\' School in her first book, Emergence: Labelled Autistic), Grandin\\'s mother placed her in Mountain Country School (now known as Hampshire Country School), a private boarding school in Rindge, New Hampshire, for children with behavioral problems. It was here that Grandin met William Carlock, a science teacher who had worked for NASA, who would become her mentor and help significantly towards building up her self-confidence.\\nIt was Carlock who gave Grandin the idea to build herself a \\'hug box\\' (referred to as a \\'squeeze machine\\' by Grandin) when she returned from her aunt\\'s farm in Arizona in her senior year of high school. With Carlock\\'s assistance, Grandin built her \\'squeeze machine\\' at the age of 18 when she was still attending Mountain Country School. Carlock\\'s supportive role in Grandin\\'s life continued even after she left Mountain Country School. For example, when Grandin was facing criticism for her \\'squeeze machine\\' at Franklin Pierce College, it was Carlock who suggested that Grandin undertake scientific experiments to evaluate the efficacy of the device. It was his constant guidance to Grandin to refocus her rigid obsessions with the \\'squeeze machine\\' into a productive assignment that allowed this study undertaken by Grandin to be subsequently widely cited as evidence of Grandin\\'s resourcefulness.\\n\\nHigher education\\nAfter she graduated in 1966 from Mountain Country School, Grandin went on to earn her bachelor\\'s degree in human psychology from Franklin Pierce College in 1970, a master\\'s degree in animal science from Arizona State University in 1975, and a doctoral degree in animal science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1989.\\n\\nCareer\\nGrandin is a prominent and widely cited proponent for the humane treatment of livestock for slaughter. She is also internationally famous as a spokesperson on autism.\\nSteve Silberman in his book NeuroTribes wrote that Temple Grandin helped break down years of shame and stigma because she was one of the first adults to publicly disclose that she was autistic. Bernard Rimland, a father of a son with autism and author of the book Infantile Autism, wrote the foreword to Grandin\\'s first book Emergence: Labeled Autistic. The book was published in 1986. Dr. Rimland wrote \"Temple\\'s ability to convey to the reader her innermost feelings and fears, coupled with her capacity for explaining mental processes will give the reader an insight into autism that very few have been able to achieve.\"\\nIn her later book Thinking in Pictures, published in 1995, the neurologist Oliver Sacks wrote at the end of the foreword that the book provided \"a bridge between our world and hers, and allows us to glimpse into a quite other sort of mind.\"\\nIn her early writings, Grandin made the mistake of presenting herself as a recovered autistic and in his foreword Bernard Rimland used the term recovered autistic individual. In her later writings, this has been removed. Steve Silberman wrote, \"It became obvious to her, however, that she was not recovered but had learned with great effort to adapt to the social norms of the people around her.\"\\nWhen her book Thinking in Pictures was written in 1995, Grandin thought that all individuals with autism thought in photographic specific images the way she did. When the expanded edition was published in 2006, she now realized that it had been wrong to assume that every person with autism processed information the same way she did. In this edition, she wrote that there were three types of specialized thinking. They were: 1. Visual Thinkers like her who think in photographically specific images. 2. Music and Math Thinkers – these people think in patterns and may be good at mathematics, chess, and programming computers. 3. Verbal Logic Thinkers – These people think in word details and their favorite subject may be history.\\nIn one of her newer books, The Autistic Brain: Thinking Across the Spectrum, the concept of three different types of thinking in autism is further developed. This book was published in 2013. An influential book which helped her develop her concept of pattern thinking was Clara Claiborne Park\\'s book titled Exiting Nirvana: A Daughter\\'s Life with Autism. It was published in 2001. The Autistic Brain also contains an extensive review of scientific studies that provide evidence that object visual thinking is different from spatial visualization abilities.\\nIn 1980 she published her first two scientific articles on beef cattle behavior during handling: \"Livestock Behavior as Related to Handling Facilities Design\" in the International Journal for the Study of Animal Problems, Vol. 1, pp. 33-52 and \"Observations of Cattle Behavior Applied to the Design of Cattle Handling Facilities\", Applied Animal Ethology, Vol. 6, pp. 19-31. She was one of the first scientists to report that animals are sensitive to visual distractions in handling facilities such as shadows, dangling chains, and other environmental details most people do not notice. When she got her Ph.D. at the University of Illinois, she studied the effects of environmental enrichment on pigs. The title of her dissertation was \"Effect of Rearing Environment and Environmental Enrichment on the Behavior and Neural Development in Young Pigs\". Grandin expanded on these theories in her book Animals Make Us Human.\\nIn 1993, she edited the first edition of Livestock Handling and Transport. She wrote three chapters and had chapters from contributors from around the world. Subsequent editions of the book were published in 2000, 2007, and 2014. In her academic work as a professor at Colorado State University, her graduate student Bridgett Voisinet conducted one of the early studies that showed that cattle that remained calm during handling had higher weight gains. In 1997, when the paper was published, this was a new concept. The paper is titled \"Feedlot Cattle with Calm Temperaments Have Higher Average Daily Gains Than Cattle with Excitable Temperaments\", published in The Journal of Animal Science, Vol. 75, pp. 892-896.\\nAnother important paper published by Grandin was \"Assessment of Stress During Handling and Transport\", Journal of Animal Science, 1997, Vol. 75, pp. 249-257. This paper presented the idea that an animal\\'s previous experiences with handling could have an effect on how it will react to being handled in the future, which was then a new concept in the animal-handling industry.\\nA major piece of equipment that Grandin developed was a center track (double rail) conveyor restrainer system for holding cattle during stunning in large beef plants. The first system was installed in the mid-eighties for calves and a system for large beef cattle was developed in 1990. This equipment is now being used by many large meat companies. It is described in \"Double Rail Restrainer Conveyor for Livestock Handling\", first published in the Journal of Agricultural Engineering Research, Vol. 4, pp. 327-338 in 1988, and \"Transferring results of behavioral research to industry to improve animal welfare on the farm, ranch, and slaughter plant\", Applied Animal Behavior Science, Vol. 8, pp. 215-228, published in 2003.\\nGrandin also developed an objective numerical scoring system for assessing animal welfare at slaughter plants. The use of this scoring system resulted in significant improvements in animal stunning and handling during slaughter. This work is described in \"Objective scoring of animal handling and stunning practices in slaughter plants\", Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, Vol. 212, pp. 36-39, \"The feasibility of using vocalization scoring as an indicator of poor welfare during slaughter\", Applied Animal Behavior Science, Vol. 56, pp. 121-128, and \"Effect of animal welfare audits of slaughter plants by a major fast food company on cattle handling and stunning practices\", Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, Vol. 216, pp. 848-851.\\nGrandin is the author or co-author of over 60 peer reviewed scientific papers on a variety of other animal behavior subjects. Some of the other subjects are: the effect of hair whorl position on cattle behavior, preslaughter stress and meat quality, religious slaughter, mothering behavior of beef cows, cattle temperament, and causes of bruising.\\nShe has lectured widely about her first-hand experiences of the anxiety of feeling threatened by everything in her surroundings, and of being dismissed and feared, which motivates her work in humane livestock handling processes. She studied the behavior of cattle, how they react to ranchers, movements, objects, and light. Grandin then designed adapted curved corrals, intended to reduce stress, panic and injury in animals being led to slaughter. This has proved to be a further point of criticism and controversy among animal activists who have questioned the congruence of a career built on animal slaughter alongside Grandin\\'s claims of compassion and respect for animals. While her designs are widely used throughout the slaughterhouse industry, her claim of compassion for the animals is that because of her autism she can see the animals\\' reality from their viewpoint, that when she holds an animal\\'s head in her hands as it is being slaughtered, she feels a deep, godlike connection to them.\\nHer business website promotes improvement of standards for slaughterhouses and livestock farms. The \\'squeeze machine\\' itself remains on sale at US$2000 each from Therafin Corporation. In 2004, she won a \"Proggy\" award in the \"Visionary\" category, from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.\\nOne of her notable essays about animal welfare is \"Animals Are Not Things\", in which she posits that technically, animals are property in society, but the law ultimately gives them ethical protections or rights. She compares the properties and rights of owning cows, versus owning screwdrivers, enumerating how both may be used to serve human purposes in many ways, but when it comes to inflicting pain, there is a vital distinction between such \"properties\"; legally a person can smash or grind up a screwdriver, but cannot torture an animal.\\nGrandin became well-known beyond the American autistic community, after being described by Oliver Sacks in the title narrative of his book An Anthropologist on Mars (1995), for which he won a Polk Award; the title is derived from Grandin\\'s description of how she feels around neurotypical people. She first spoke in public about autism in the mid-1980s, at the request of Ruth C. Sullivan, one of the founders of the Autism Society of America (ASA). Sullivan writes:\\n\\nI first met Temple in the mid-1980s [at the] annual [ASA] conference. Standing on the periphery of the group was a tall young woman who was obviously interested in the discussions. She seemed shy and pleasant, but mostly she just listened. I learned her name was Temple Grandin. It wasn\\'t until later in the week that I realized she was someone with autism. I approached her and asked if she\\'d be willing to speak at the next year\\'s [ASA] conference. She agreed. The next year Temple first addressed an [ASA] audience. People were standing at least three deep. The audience couldn\\'t get enough of her. Here, for the first time, was someone who could tell us from her own experience, what it was like to be extremely sound sensitive (\"like being tied to the rail and the train\\'s coming\"). She was asked many questions: \"Why does my son do so much spinning?\" \"Why does he hold his hands to his ears?\" \"Why doesn\\'t he look at me?\" She spoke from her own experience, and her insight was impressive. There were tears in more than one set of eyes that day. Temple quickly became a much sought-after speaker in the autism community.\\n\\nBased on personal experience, Grandin advocates early intervention to address autism and supportive teachers, who can direct fixations of the child with autism in fruitful directions. She has described her hypersensitivity to noise and other sensory stimuli. She says words are her second language and that she thinks \"totally in pictures,\" using her vast visual memory to translate information into a slideshow of mental images that can be manipulated or correlated. Grandin attributes her success as a humane livestock facility designer to her ability to recall detail, which is a characteristic of her visual memory. Grandin compares her memory to full-length movies in her head, that may be replayed at will, allowing her to notice small details. She also is able to view her memories using slightly different contexts by changing the positions of the lighting and shadows.\\nHer insight into the minds of cattle has taught her to value the changes in details to which animals are particularly sensitive and to use her visualization skills to design thoughtful and humane animal-handling equipment. She was named a fellow of the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers in 2009.\\nAs a partial proponent of neurodiversity, Grandin does not support eliminating autism genes or treating mildly autistic individuals. However, she believes that autistic children who are severely handicapped need therapy with applied behavioral analysis. However, she has claimed that she only will attend talks given by autistics that can hold down a career. By contrast, Jonathan Mitchell describes Grandin as making generalizations about autistic people, saying that many autistics aren\\'t visual thinkers and that her generalizations trivialize the difficulties associated with autism. The autism activist Amy Sequenzia has criticized Temple Grandin for only focusing on and listening to high-functioning autistics, as opposed to low-functioning and non-speaking autistics. She has said that Grandin doesn\\'t view those autistics as worthy of her attention.\\nIn 2012, when the American beef industry was struggling with public perception of its use and sale of pink slime, Grandin spoke out in support of the food product. She said, \"It should be on the market. It should be labeled. We should not be throwing away that much beef.\"\\n\\nPersonal life\\nGrandin says that \"the part of other people that has emotional relationships is not part of me\", and she has neither married nor had children. She later stated for example that she preferred the science fiction, documentary, and thriller genre of films and television shows to more dramatic or romantic ones. Beyond her work in animal science and welfare and autism rights, her interests include horse riding, science fiction, movies, and biochemistry.\\nShe has noted in her autobiographical works that autism affects every aspect of her life. She has to wear comfortable clothes to counteract her sensory processing disorder and has structured her lifestyle to avoid sensory overload. She regularly takes antidepressants, but no longer uses a squeeze-box (hug machine), a device which she invented at the age of 18 as a form of stress relief therapy, stating in February 2010 that: \"It broke two years ago, and I never got around to fixing it. I\\'m into hugging people now.\"\\n\\nHonors\\nIn 2010, Grandin was named in the Time 100 list of the one hundred most influential people in the world in the \"Heroes\" category. In 2011, she received a Double Helix Medal. She has received honorary degrees from many universities including McGill University in Canada (1999), and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (2009), Carnegie Mellon University in the United States (2012), and Emory University (2016). In 2015, she was named an Honorary Fellow of the Society for Technical Communication.\\nIn 2012, Grandin was inducted into the Texas Trail of Fame.\\nGrandin received a Meritorious Achievement Award from the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) in 2015.\\nIn 2016, Grandin was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\\nIn 2017, Grandin was inducted into the National Women\\'s Hall of Fame.\\n\\nIn popular culture\\nGrandin has been featured on major media programs, such as Lisa Davis\\' It\\'s Your Health, ABC\\'s Primetime Live, the Today Show, Larry King Live, and Fresh Air with Terry Gross. She has been written up in TIME magazine, People magazine, Discover magazine, Forbes, and The New York Times. In 2012, Grandin was interviewed on Thriving Canine Radio to discuss \"A Different Perspective on Animal Behavior\".\\nShe was the subject of the Horizon documentary, \"The Woman Who Thinks Like a Cow\", first broadcast by the BBC on June 8, 2006, and Nick News with Linda Ellerbee in the spring of 2006. She also has been the subject of the first episode in the series First Person by Errol Morris.\\nGrandin is the focus of a semi-biographical HBO film, titled Temple Grandin, starring Claire Danes as Grandin. The film was broadcast on February 6, 2010. The movie was nominated for 15 Primetime Emmy Awards and won seven awards, including Outstanding Television Movie and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Movie for Claire Danes. Grandin was on stage as the award was accepted, and she spoke briefly to the audience. Coincidentally, the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards happened on Grandin\\'s birthday – August 29. On January 16, 2011, at the 68th Golden Globe Awards, Claire Danes won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film.\\nGrandin was featured in Beautiful Minds: A Voyage Into the Brain, a documentary produced in 2006 by colourFIELD tell-a-vision, a German company. She was named one of 2010\\'s one hundred most influential people in the world by Time magazine. In 2011, she was featured in an episode of the Science documentary series Ingenious Minds.\\nShe also was interviewed by Michael Pollan in his best-selling book, The Omnivore\\'s Dilemma, in which she discussed the livestock industry.\\nFolk-punk band AJJ, formerly known as Andrew Jackson Jihad, included two songs called \"Temple Grandin\" and \"Temple Grandin Too\" on their LP Christmas Island.\\n\\nPublications\\nEmergence: Labeled Autistic (with Margaret Scariano, 1986, updated 1991), ISBN 0-446-67182-7\\nThe Learning Style of People with Autism: An Autobiography (1995).

She is best known as a cast member of the reality TV show Shark Tank and has been called \"one of the most prolific inventors of our time\". Also known as \"The Queen of QVC\" and the “Warm Blooded Shark”. She has also appeared on Shark Tank spin-off, Beyond the Tank. Since 1998, she has appeared on the QVC program Clever & Unique Creations Show. She is also president and founder of the Chicago company For Your Ease Only, Inc., which she established in 1996 and which does product development and marketing. She has invented more than 600 products and helps aspiring entrepreneurs launch theirs. She holds 120 U.S. and foreign patents.\\n\\nEarly life\\nGreiner grew up on the Near North Side, Chicago, the 2nd daughter of a real estate developer father and a psychologist mother. Her parents divorced when she was nine years old. She majored in communications, focusing on journalism, television, and film at Loyola University Chicago, and worked for the Chicago Tribune while in college. She was briefly a playwright and also designed and sold her own jewelry on the side.\\n\\nCareer\\nGreiner created and patented a plastic earring organizer with sliding rods that could neatly store 100 pairs of earrings. Using borrowed money, she created a prototype of the product which was picked up by J. C. Penney before the holiday season. She took out a $300,000 loan and in eighteen months had paid it back.\\n\\nQVC\\nGreiner says “she never set out to be a serial inventor”, but her success on the Home Shopping Network started her on that path. Shortly thereafter, she transitioned to QVC, a larger network, and in 2000, after she created an arsenal of new products, she landed her own show on QVC called Clever & Unique Creations.\\n\\nShark Tank\\nIn 2012, Greiner joined the US TV series Shark Tank. In 2014, her investment in Scrub Daddy, a company that produces a texture changing household sponge (the material is stiff in cold water but soft when warm), was noted as a great success. On July 30, 2014, she sold more than 2 million sponges on QVC (in one day alone).\\nAs of April 30, 2016, Scrub Daddy reigned as “the biggest success story in Shark Tank history” with sales over $100 million and a growing product line sold in a myriad of stores.\\nOther investments by Greiner in the top 18 Shark Tank deals, as of April 30, 2016, include Squatty Potty, Readerest, Paint Brush Cover, Hold Your Haunches, Drop Stop, FiberFix, Simply Fit Board, and Screenmend.\\nAs of September 15, 2017, Greiner’s Simply Fit Board (an exercise tool), Scrub Daddy, and Sleep Styler (comfortable hair rollers) are cited as 3 of the biggest Shark Tank hits to date.\\nIn 2011, Greiner spoke at the first United States Patent and Trademark Office Women\\'s Entrepreneurship Symposium. In March 2014, she published the book Invent it, Sell it, Bank it! – Make Your Million Dollar Idea into a Reality, which reached #3 on the Wall Street Journal\\'s bestseller list.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nLori is married to Dan Greiner.\\n\\nFurther reading\\nGreiner, Lori.

She married Samuel Guppy in 1795. In 1811 she patented the first of her inventions, a method of making safe piling for bridges. Thomas Telford asked her for permission to use her patented design for suspension bridge foundations, and she granted it to him free of charge. As a friend of Isambard Kingdom Brunel and his family she became involved in the Great Western Railway, writing to the directors with ideas and giving her support. In 1841 she wrote a letter recommending planting willows and poplars to stabilise embankments. She continued to offer technical advice despite the fact that, as she wrote, \"it is unpleasant to speak of oneself—it may seem boastful particularly in a woman.\"\\n\\nPatents and publications\\nThe family took out 10 patents in the first half of the nineteenth century, including a method of keeping ships free of barnacles that led to a government contract worth £40,000. Other inventions included a bed with built-in exercise equipment, a device for a tea or coffee urn which would cook eggs in the steam as well as having a small dish to keep toast warm and a device for \"improvements in caulking ships, boats and other vessels.\" In later life she wrote The Cottagers and Labourers Friend and Dialogues for Children, invented the fire hood or Cook\\'s Comforter, and patented a new type of candlestick that enabled candles to burn longer.\\n\\nMarriage and family\\nAfter marrying Bristol merchant Samuel Guppy they lived in Queen Square and Prince Street, a leading light of the Bristol and Clifton social scene. The couple had six children, including Thomas Richard, who with older brother Samuel operated the Friars Sugar Refinery in Bristol (1826–42) before becoming an engineer and associate of Brunel, contributing significantly to the design of SS Great Western and SS Great Britain. Brunel painted a portrait of the younger Sarah Guppy c. 1836.\\n\\nLater life\\nIn 1837 the widowed Sarah, now 67, married Richard Eyre Coote, 28 years her junior. For a while they lived at Arnos Court, Brislington, but Richard ran through his rich wife\\'s money at a rapid rate, spending on horses and neglecting her. Sarah moved into 7 Richmond Hill, Clifton, in 1842. She bought the land opposite the house for the benefit of Clifton residents and it still remains green space.\\n\\n\\n== Notes and references =='), (1092, 'Mandy Nicola Haberman (born 1956) is an English inventor and entrepreneur.

She is best known for her invention of a type of visual music she called Nourathar.\\nThomas Eakins painted her portrait in 1903, currently in the Roland P. Murdock Collection of the Wichita Museum of Art.\\n\\nBiography\\nGreenewalt was born in 1871 in Beirut, then part of Syria, to Samuel Hallock and Sara Tabet. After her mother began exhibiting symptoms of mental illness, eleven-year-old Greenewalt and her siblings were sent to live with friends and relatives in the US, where Greenewalt spent the remainder of her youth in the Philadelphia area. As a young adult Greenewalt studied piano at the Philadelphia Conservatory of Music and then with Theodor Leschetizky in Vienna. After her return to Philadelphia she married Frank L. Greenewalt, a physician. The couple had one son, Crawford Hallock Greenewalt, a chemical engineer who eventually served as president of the DuPont Company. In her later years Greenewalt resided in Wilmington, Delaware. She died in Philadelphia at the age of 79.\\n\\nRecordings\\nColumbia Records released her performance of Chopin\\'s \"Preludes in E Minor, C minor, A Major\" and \"Nocturne in G Major\" in March, 1920 (A6136).\\n\\nInventions\\n\\'Color organ\\'\\nThe name for her art, Nourathar, was adapted from the Arabic words for light (nour), and essence of (athar). Unlike earlier inventors of color-music such as the painter A. Wallace Rimington, Hallock-Greenewalt did not produce a strict definition of correspondence between specific colors and particular notes, instead arguing that these relationships were inherently variable and reflected the temperament and ability of the performer.\\n\\nHer earliest attempts at creating this art entailed her construction of an automated machine where colored lights were synchronized to records. This produced an unsatisfactory result, leading to her development of an instrument that could actually be played live.\\nHer color organ, which she named \"Sarabet\" after her mother, required her to invent a number of new technologies. She received nine patents from the US Patent office for them. Among these devices was a non-linear variety of rheostat, a patent that was infringed by General Electric and other companies. She sued them for infringement and won in 1934. The Sarabet went through a series of refinements between 1916 and 1934. In 1946 she published a book on her invented art of \"light-color playing\" called Nourathar: The Fine Art of Light-Color Playing.\\n\\nHand-painted films\\nMichael Betancourt has noted Hallock-Greenewalt also produced the earliest hand-painted films known to still exist. However, these were not movies but films produced specifically to be performed by her earliest version of the Sarabet which was a machine for automatic accompaniment to records. Its construction, where a single viewer looked down into the machine at the film itself, resembled Edison\\'s kinetoscope. This device was an early music visualizer of the type now included with computer audio-players. Even though these films were not designed to be motion pictures, they were produced with templates and aerosol sprays, producing repeating geometric patterns in the same way as the hand painted films of Len Lye from the 1930s.\\n\\nSee also\\nClavier à lumières\\nLouis Bertrand Castel\\nNew Epoch Notation Painting\\nThomas Wilfred\\nOskar Fischinger\\nWilliam Moritz\\n\\nReferences\\nMary Hallock-Greenewalt, \"Nourathar\" [Westbrook Publishing, 1946]\\nMichael Betancourt, \"Mary Hallock-Greenewalt\\'s Abstract Films.\" [Millennium Film Journal no 45, 2006]\\nMichael Betancourt, \"Mary Hallock-Greenewalt: The Complete Patents.\" [Wildside Press, 2005]\\nBiography and Genealogy Master Index.

She was the first person in Sweden to produce telephone wires commercially. She manufactured the wires for the first Swedish telephone network. She also exported wire to Finland.\\nHanna Hammarström was the daughter of the cotton and silk merchant Per Hammarström (d. 1868) and Christina Holmberg. Her father wished for all his children to learn a profession, so she learned to manufacture various forms of ornaments. Though telephone wires were invented before her, the way to make them was not known in Sweden, so the Swedish telephone network depended on foreign manufacturers. Hammarström managed to develop telephone wires by herself with the knowledge she learned by making ornaments out of metal strings. She started her own factory, and in 1883 took over the task of providing telephone wires to the Swedish telephone company. She had a monopoly on the production through the 1880s and 1890s. In her factory in Stockholm, she employed only women, whom she educated herself. In 1886, she was awarded first prize for her invention at a machinery exhibition in Stockholm.

She served as the president of the toy manufacturer Mattel Inc., and is best remembered for inventing the Barbie doll, although the doll\\'s design was created by missile engineer-turned-toy designer Jack Ryan.\\n\\nEarly life\\nHandler was born as Ruth Marianna Mosko in Denver, Colorado, to Polish Jewish immigrants Ida Mosko (née Rubenstein) and Jacob Mosko. She married her high school boyfriend, Elliot Handler, and moved to Los Angeles in 1938. Her husband decided to make their furniture out of two newfound types of plastics, Lucite and Plexiglas. Ruth Handler suggested that he start doing this commercially and they began a furniture business. Ruth Handler worked as the sales force for the new business, landing contracts with Douglas Aircraft Company and others.\\n\\nFormation of Mattel\\nHer husband Elliot Handler and his business partner Harold \"Matt\" Matson formed a small company to manufacture picture frames, calling it \"Mattel\" by combining part of their names (\"Matt\" and \"Elliot\"). Later, they began using scraps from the manufacturing process to make dollhouse furniture. The furniture was more profitable than the picture frames and it was decided to concentrate on toy manufacturing. The company\\'s first big-seller was the \"Uke-a-doodle\", a toy ukulele.\\n\\nBarbie\\nRuth Handler claimed her daughter Barbara, who was becoming a pre-teen, played with paper dolls by pretending they were adults. Handler noticed that in such play, children would act out future events, rather than the present. Handler noted the limitations of the paper dolls, including how the paper clothing failed to attach well. She wanted to produce a three-dimensional plastic \"paper doll\" with an adult body and a wardrobe of fabric clothing, but her husband and Mr. Matson thought parents would not buy their children a doll with a voluptuous figure. While the Handler family was vacationing in Europe, Ruth Handler saw the German Bild Lilli doll (which was not a children\\'s toy, but rather an adult gag gift) in a Swiss shop and brought it home. The Lilli doll was a representation of the same concept Ruth had been trying to sell to other Mattel executives.\\nOnce home, she reworked the design of the doll and named her Barbie after the Handlers\\' daughter, Barbara. Barbie debuted at the New York toy fair on March 9, 1959, but was not an immediate success. When Disney introduced The Mickey Mouse Club children\\'s television show, Mattel invested heavily in television advertising. The TV commercials for the Barbie doll paid off and Barbie rocketed Mattel and the Handlers to fame and fortune. Subsequently, they would add a boyfriend for Barbie named Ken, after the Handlers\\' son, and many other \"friends and family\" to Barbie\\'s world.\\n\\nLater years\\nHandler was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1970. She had a modified radical mastectomy, which was often used at the time to combat the disease, and because of difficulties in finding a good breast prosthesis, she decided to make her own. Handler went on to found a company, Ruthton Corp., formed by her and Peyton Massey, which manufactured a more realistic version of a woman\\'s breast, called \"Nearly Me\". She personally fitted one for the then first lady, Betty Ford.\\nIn 1974, Handler resigned from Mattel after investigations of producing fraudulent financial reports. In 1978, Handler was charged with fraud and false reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission. She pleaded no contest, was fined $57,000 and sentenced to 2,500 hours of community service.She blamed her illness for making her \"unfocused\" on her business.\\nThough the Handlers took a more hands-off approach to their company\\'s business practice after resigning, they continued to create new ideas. One project Handler took on in the 1980s was Barbie and the Rockers. She was credited as a writer of the 1987 film Barbie and the Rockers: Out of this World. Handler was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1997.\\nHer most enduring creation, however, went from strength to strength. Barbie has inspired artists from Andy Warhol to the pop group Aqua. There is a Barbie in the Smithsonian Institute, and a Barbie was selected in 1976 to be buried in the official time capsule celebrating the bicentennial of the United States. Barbie - who now has nearly a billion outfits in her wardrobe - was joined by Ken in 1961 and the first black Barbie appeared in 1981.\\nShe died in California from complications of surgery for colon cancer on April 27, 2002, aged 85. Her husband Elliot died nine years later at the age of 95.\\n\\nReferences\\nGerber, Robin. Barbie and Ruth: The Story of the World\\'s Most Famous Doll and the Woman Who Created Her.

She worked as a cheesemaker at the Manor of Beaumoncel and made Camembert cheeses according to local custom. Her main contribution was to have initiated a dynasty of entrepreneurial cheesemakers who developed the production of Camembert cheese on a large scale, notably her grandson Cyrille Paynel, born in 1817, who created a cheese factory in the commune of Le Mesnil-Mauger in Calvados at France.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nMarie Harel was born Marie Catherine Fontaine on April 28, 1761, at Crouttes (Orne), near Vimoutiers in Normandy. On May 10, 1785, in Camembert, Orne, she married Jacques Harel, a laborer at Roiville. She died November 9, 1844, at Vimoutiers, Orne.\\n\\nInvention of Camembert\\nSince the end of the 17th century, a renowned cheese was being produced in the Camembert region of Normandy. In his Geographic Dictionary, published in 1708, Thomas Corneille wrote: \"Vimonstiers: [...] every Monday a large market is held, to which are brought excellent cheeses from Livarot and Camembert.\" However, according to a later legend which appeared at the beginning of the 20th century, the invention of Camembert cheese was attributed to Marie Harel who would have benefited from the advice of a refractory priest, Abbot Charles-Jean Bonvoust, who was hidden in 1796-97 at the Manor of Beaumoncel where she worked. Supposedly, he was a native of Brie and passed along to Marie a recipe for a kind of cheese with a bloomy edible rind, such as was produced in his native area. In reality, Bonvoust came from Pays de Caux. This apocryphal story, for which there is no evidence, is still often accepted as true.\\nMarie Harel did make Camembert cheese, according to local custom. She initiated a dynasty of entrepreneurial cheese makers who produced Camembert cheese on a large scale, notably her grandson Cyrille Paynel, born in 1817, who created a cheese factory in the commune of Le Mesnil-Mauger in Calvados.\\n\\nThe success of the production of Camembert in the first half of the 19th century was largely due to the descendants of Harel, who considered themselves the only legitimate users of the designation \"Camembert\". However, beginning in 1870, other Norman cheese makers contested this family monopoly.\\nThe town of Vimoutiers had a statue to her. On 14 June 1944, during the Battle of Normandy, Vimoutiers was bombarded by Allied forces. The village was destroyed and 220 people died. 400 people of Van Wert, Ohio contributed in the costs of reconstruction and reparation of the town including the replacement of Marie Harel\\'s statue in 1953. This is recorded by a plaque in the market square of Vimoutiers.\\nA legend says that she died in Champosoult, but actually it was her daughter, also named Marie (1781–1855), who died there. Harel was also honored with a Google Doodle on the occasion of her 256th birthday in 2017.\\n\\nSee also\\nTypes of cheese\\n\\nReferences\\nFurther reading\\nPierre Boisard, Le Camembert, mythe français, Paris, Odile Jacob, 2007.'), (1097, 'Elise Frances Harmon (née Harmon; 3 September 1909 in Mount Enterprise, Texas – 6 March 1985 in Santa Clara County, California) was an American physicist, chemist, and influential contributor to the miniaturization of computers.\\n\\nCareer highlights\\nResearch\\nDuring World War II, she worked in the United States Naval Research Laboratory\\'s Aircraft and Electrical Division.

Born in Canada, Harper was sent away by her father when she was seven to work as a domestic servant. She worked in that profession for 25 years before she saved enough money to start working full-time producing a hair tonic she invented. The product, and the creation of special hair salons that utilized it, was successful. Harper began franchising the salon model to low-income women, and by its peak the company included more than 500 franchises and an entire line of hair care products.\\n\\nEarly years\\nMartha Matilda Harper was Born in Oakville, Ontario, Canada. Her parent's were Robert and Beadie Harper. She didn't receive a lot of formal education as a young child. Harper's father sent her away at age seven to become a domestic servant for relatives in Orno, Ontario. She worked in that profession for 22 years before moving to the United States to work as a servant in Rochester, New York. She worked for a minister and her last Canadian employer, a physician, had imparted his knowledge of hair health to her, and bequeathed her his hair tonic formula when he died. She learned to respect scientific principles from the physician which benefitted her while making the hair tonic. While a servant, Harper developed her own hair tonic after becoming concerned that the hair products on the market did more harm than good. She started making the tonic in the shed of where she was working as a servant. She saved enough money to begin producing the hair tonic full-time, and, upon leaving domestic service three years after her immigration to the United States, opened the first public hair salon in the region in order to help market it. Her salon opened in 1888 in Rochester using her life savings of $360.\\n\\nCompany\\nHarper’s salon The Harper Hair Parlour, and many of her innovations, including the Harper Method, underlie the modern concept of the hair salon. Before Harper, hairdressers used to make home visits. She used her hair tonic on herself to advertise. Her floor-length hair also served as an effective marketing tool and appeared in many advertisements for her products. She hired former servants to staff her salon Her salon was franchised, and each franchise was run by a women. In 1891, she became one of the first businesspeople in America to start franchising, allowing franchisees to open salons under the Harper name. Each women owned the salon but she would train the franchisees and inspect their salons to ensure quality. Her first franchise was in Buffalo NY.\\nEmphasizing customer service and comfort, Harper invented reclining shampoo chairs, which became a common feature of salons worldwide. The salons offered scalp massage and child care, and they provided evening hours. The hair products her company produced were intended to be healthier than those widely available at the time and were made largely with natural products. Harper salons did not carry synthetic dyes or do chemical perms.\\n\\nFamous clientele\\nAt the height of its success, her company had 500 franchises and produced a full line of hair care and beauty products. Among the Harper customers were Susan B. Anthony, Woodrow Wilson, Grace Coolidge, and Jacqueline Kennedy.\\n\\nCompany Legacy\\nThe Harper Method Inc. has operated under a variety of different owners. In June 1956, Robert McBain, Harper's husband, sold the enterprise to Earl Freese and Gerald Wunderlich who then made three different attempts to sell the business throughout the 1960s and 70s.\\nIn 1971, Robert Prentices, then manager of the Harper manufacturing centre in St. Catharine’s, Ontario, purchased the factory assets along with Harper manufacturing and distribution rights, renaming the company Niagara Mist Marketing Ltd, also known as The Soap Factory.\\nOn March 10, 1972, other Harper Method Inc., assets were bought by PEJ Beauty Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Wilfred Academy. At the time, PEJ was one of the largest operators of trade schools in America. According to Philip Jakeway, then President of the Wilfred Academy, he hoped to expand his operation by marketing the Harper products and shops. An agreement was reached whereby Prentice would supply Harper products to Jakeway for U.S. distribution.Jakeway was unsuccessful.”\\nAs for The Harper Method Founder’s Shop, it operated in Rochester, New York, as the country’s oldest, and longest running, beauty shop until the early 2000s. It was the last Harper shop to remain open.\\n\\nDeath and legacy\\nMartha died on August 3, 1950, one month short of her 93rd birthday, survived by her husband Robert MacBain, who later died on April 30, 1965, at the age of 83. At time of her death there were over 350 shops. Her gravesite is at Riverside Cemetery, Rochester NY.\\nDuring her lifetime, aside from business affairs, Haper also liked cooking, travel, and golf.\\nShe was a member of Rochester Country Club and Oak Hill Country Club. She also studied at University of Rochester for a few classes.\\nIn 2003, Harper was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame for her achievements in business.

For 12 years, she was married to the television broadcaster Kenneth MacLeod before separating in 1968. MacLeod was one of the first seen in the early days of Rediffusion and from 1968 for many years was the 6 o\\'clock evening Westward Diary anchorman at Westward Television. They had two daughters.\\nBorn in 1926, Hart was educated at various convents and then at Abbot\\'s Hill School, King\\'s Langley (where she was a Classics scholar). She went after her Matriculation at 14 to RADA at a very young age in 1941. She started working for the BBC as a secretary and, in the middle years of the Second World War, as an audio engineer, where she played Hitler\\'s speeches back to the Germans from the BBC in the UK over their airwaves.\\nIt was in 1943 that Hart started on stage as a feed in a double act with the comedian (later an agent) Pat Aza at the Finsbury Park Empire. This led to a six-month tour of the Moss Empires circuit on the halls. After this, she continued her war service entertaining the troops for ENSA.\\nHer theatre breakthrough came with her casting in a supporting role in Daughter Janie Apollo Theatre (1944), which led to William Douglas-Home\\'s early hit The Chiltern Hundreds (Vaudeville Theatre (1946), and Booth Theatre, New York (1949). In this political light comedy, centred round an \\'Earl of Lister\\' and a local by-election, Hart played the comic role of the young housemaid Bessie opposite A. E. Matthews.\\n\\nLater Career\\nWhen Glynis Johns – the original choice – became unavailable for Terence Rattigan\\'s comedy Who Is Sylvia? at the Criterion Theatre (1950), Hart was cast instead. In this production, she had to play three roles, one in each act, as an office girl, an actress and a model. The play opened at the home of Rattigan\\'s first success, French Without Tears, and also co-starred two of its cast, Robert Flemyng and Roland Culver. It ran for just under a year and gained the young Diane Hart positive critical reviews.\\nIn Nancy Mitford\\'s version of Andrew Roussin\\'s French farce The Little Hut at the Lyric Theatre in 1950, Hart was cast for the West End version instead of the American actress who had created the role, Joan Tetzel, taking over opposite Robert Morley, with Peter Brook as director. She also enjoyed a six-month stint as Mollie Ralston in one of the earliest runs of The Mousetrap (Ambassadors Theatre (1953), and then abandoned the stage for 11 years in favour of television and the cinema.\\nIn March 1963, she translated the Sardou play Divorce A La Carte and appeared in the production of the same with John Justin, Barry Shawzin and Katy Greenwood at the Phoenix Theatre in London. In 1964, she appeared on the West End stage with her friend, Margaret Lockwood (with whom she had first worked in The Wicked Lady) in Every Other Evening, also at the Phoenix. A long-running engagement came Hart\\'s way with Joyce Rayburn\\'s West End comedy The Man Most Likely To... (Vaudeville Theatre (1968), opposite Leslie Phillips. She had another long vaudeville residency acting with Terence Alexander and replacing Moira Lister in the successful Ray Cooney/John Chapman farce Move Over, Mrs Markham (1972).\\nShe also participated in theatre in Sloane Square when she worked at the Royal Court Theatre. Hart\\'s first appearance there was as the mother in an early Howard Barker play, Cheek at the Royal Court Theatre Upstairs (1970). She then took a role in Morality (Royal Court Theatre Upstairs, 1971), a piece by Jeremy Seabrook and Michael O\\'Neill, directed by William Gaskill, a domestic drama about a schoolboy involved in a homosexual relationship with a teacher.\\nIn later years, she often worked in regional theatre, playing, among other parts, the title role in Somerset Maugham\\'s Mrs Dot (Everyman Theatre, Cheltenham, 1974), in The Bank Manager (East Grinstead, 1974), Miss Adams Will Be Waiting (Yvonne Arnaud, Guildford, 1975) and The Pleasure Principle (New End, Hampstead 1989) and other plays.\\nHart\\'s film career, started much earlier, in the 1940s, with a small role as a bridesmaid in the Margaret Lockwood costume drama The Wicked Lady (1945), and included a contract to 20th Century-Fox. She also worked for Jean Negulesco in Britannia Mews (1949), scripted by Ring Lardner Jr., and playing opposite David Niven in the musical Happy Go Lovely (1951). Hart\\'s then husband, Kenneth MacLeod, was also in the film with a small part.\\nShe made many television appearances, beginning at Alexandra Palace during the war, as well as radio performances for Val Gielgud, and she played Ted Ray\\'s wife in Season 4 of the Ray\\'s a Laugh series.\\nApart from acting, one of her inventions was the \"Beatnix\" corselet [1], which during the 1960s had large sales at Britain\\'s Marks and Spencer. One customer was in the Soviet Union, the wife of the Russian premier, Mrs Alexei Kosygin. She also persuaded the British War Office to adopt another of her inventions, when she suggested they attach harrows to a helicopter to clear landmines during the Falklands campaign.\\nIn politics, Hart once tried to set up a \"Women\\'s Party\" for the UK. She posted an anonymous advertisement in the personal columns of The Times which read: \"Ladies. Don\\'t just sit there. If you are sick of castles in the air, sit in the House of Commons. Wanted, 630 ladies willing to gamble £500 each fighting a constituency.\" \"Castles in the air\" was a reference to Barbara Castle, MP, who at the time was the only prominent British female politician. Hart hired Caxton Hall in central London for a rally, but only about forty women turned up.\\nLater, she ran in the General Election of 1970 as an Independent candidate for Lewisham South but lost her deposit. She was criticised by Germaine Greer in a footnote in the last pages of her work The Female Eunuch.\\nIn 1977, Hart led a legal action (Source: The Times, 25 August 1977) against the actors\\' union Equity, of which she was a longstanding member, to stop a referendum of their members over changes to union rules. Four years later, she also successfully took on the Aga Khan Foundation United Kingdom, conducting the five-day \\'plaintiff in person\\' without legal counsel. She was awarded £750 damages at the High Court (Source: The Times, 16 June 1981) to compensate her for the noise and nuisance caused by the construction of the Ismaili Centre opposite her home in London nearby the Victoria and Albert Museum.\\nHart was also plaintiff in person in her litigation in 1985, when she was awarded £15,000 (Source: The Times, 12 November 1985) in libel damages after a clip was taken from Games That Lovers Play (1971), a film in which she appeared with Joanna Lumley, Richard Wattis, Jeremy Lloyd, Penny Brahms and Nan Munro. This clip was incorporated illegally into a pornographic film called Electric Blue, 002 [2].\\nIn her last years, she spent time at the Chelsea Arts Club, where she was a member and where she everyday completed The Times and The Daily Telegraph cryptic crosswords with great speed.

Her education focused on science and research where she developed a passion for microbiology. Her peers and teachers knew her as a quick learner and a bright student. In 1948, she teamed up with Rachel Fuller Brown to develop nystatin, the first non-toxic drug treatment for fungal infections in humans. Her research had multiple applications ranging from saving infected trees to restoring paintings and artwork damaged due to mold.\\n\\nEarly life\\nElizabeth Lee Hazen was born on August 24, 1885, in Rich, Mississippi, to William Edgar Hazen and Maggie Harper Hazen. She was their second daughter and middle of three children. Her parents died when she was four, and the three children were adopted by an aunt and uncle.\\n\\nEducation\\nHazen attended the Mississippi University for Women (then Mississippi Industrial Institute and College), and obtained a Bachelor of Science degree there in 1910. While teaching biology and high school physics in Jackson, Mississippi, she continued her education by attending summer schools at the University of Tennessee and University of Virginia. Following her teaching job, Hazen applied and was accepted into Department of Biology at Columbia for graduate studies. She completed a Master's of Biology at Columbia University in 1917 and a Ph.D. in microbiology there in 1927, one their first female doctoral students. She served as an Army diagnostic laboratory technician during World War I. In the 1920s, while studying at Columbia University, Hazen worked with ricin and its effect on Clostridium botulinum toxin.\\n\\nScientific work\\nAfter graduation\\nWith her strong science background and experience in the field, Hazen continued her research in bacteria and immunology. She was presented with an opportunity in 1931 to work with the New York State Department of Health. She accepted and worked in the Bacterial Diagnosis Laboratory Division in New York City. She had several major accomplishments there in the field of bacterial diagnosis. Among her works there were tracing an outbreak of anthrax, locating sources of tularemia, and tracing the source of food poisoning from improperly preserved foods.\\nFrom there, she worked at the New York office of the Division of Laboratories and Research of the State Department of Public Health. There she learned, trained, and studied about fungi and fungal diseases. She had picked up a project there and started producing her own culture collection. This collection and the research along with it helped place her name in the National Inventors Hall of Fame.\\n\\nDevelopment of nystatin\\nIn 1944, she was chosen by Augustus Wadsworth, founder and head of the division, to be in charge of an investigation into fungi and their relation to bacteria and other microbes. In addition to a microbiologist (Hazen), a biochemist was also needed, and Rachel Fuller Brown was chosen. Hazen started researching and studying fungal diseases, specifically ones that had been widespread in the city. This included diseases such as pneumonia and moniliasis (thrush), a mouth condition that makes swallowing painful. She had a growing collection of fungi and was studying the effects and possible antifungal agents. However, Elizabeth needed someone to identify and isolate the antifungal activity occurring within samples. She was introduced by Dalldorf, the direction of the division in Albany, in 1948 to Rachel Fuller Brown, who had a laboratory in Albany.\\nTheir research started by collecting soil samples from all over the country. Dr. Hazen cultured Actinomycetes (microorganisms most frequently having antifungal properties) from each sample and tested them to see if any fungal activity was present. If any activity was found, the soil sample was shipped to Albany, where Dr. Brown prepared samples and extracts from the cultures by isolating the chemical agents that appeared to have the property of killing fungi. These new samples would then be shipped back to New York City, where Hazen would test the samples again for toxicity. She would expose the organisms against two fungi, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. She would then purify promising samples for further test of fungistatic and fungicidal activity.\\nIn 1948, Hazen and Brown began searching for an effective antifungal agent. Hazen found a promising micro-organism in the soil of a friend's dairy farm. She named it named Streptomyces noursei, after William Nourse, the farm's owner. S. noursei was found to produce two antifungal substances. One turned out to be toxic for mice, but the other, when purified, turned out to be effective against candidiasis and a fungus that invaded the lungs and central nervous system. In 1950, they presented their discovery, the first safe and effective antifungal antibiotic, to the National Academy of Sciences. They originally named it fungicidin, but later renamed it nystatin, in honor of their employer, the New York State Department of Public Health.\\nIn fall 1950, Dr. Hazen and Dr. Brown announced at a National Academy of Sciences meeting that they had successfully produced two antifungal agents from an antibiotic. This led to their development of nystatin (named in honor of the New York State Public Health Department), the first fungicide safe for treating humans. After several animal and human studies proved satisfactory to the FDA, nystatin was put into the market through E.R. Squibb & Sons in 1954 and earning over $135,000 in its first year. Hazen and Brown donated their royalties, over $13 million, to a trust fund established under both Hazen and Brown for science and advancing women in science.\\n\\nPatent\\nNystatin (antifungal / antibiotic) Patent Number: 2,797, 183\\nA patent was filed in late 1950 for nystatin. It took Hazen, Brown, and Squibb Research Company six and half years to secure a patent for the invention. Two reasons caused the delay. First, testing had to be done to prove the utility of the product. This required animal and human trials to be conducted for FDA approval. Nystatin was granted approval by the FDA and released by Squibb in 1954. In addition, an article published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology in 1954 suggested Hazen and Brown exposed methods of nystatin in another article previously published in 1949. If this were the case, then it would have been over a year before a patent was filed, rendering the pending patent useless. However, after research and a signature by the author of the 1954 article stating there was no connection, the U.S. Patent Office issued a patent on June 25, 1957. It covered nystatin and the method of preparation for the next 17 years. Hazen and Brown obtained the patent in 1957.\\n\\nLater life\\nDr. Hazen continued to do research in laboratory in her later years as her experience and skills were very useful and beneficial to those around her. She continued to study the several uses of nystatin for other diseases and conditions.\\n\\nAwards\\nTowards the end of her life, she received a series of awards for her success, including the Squibb Award in Chemotherapy, the Rhoda Benham Award of the Medical Mycological Society of the Americas, an honorary degree from Hobart and William Smith Colleges, and the Chemical Pioneer Award of the American Institute of Chemists. After her death, Hazen was nominated and accepted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1994.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nBrown and Hazen Papers, 1937-1981.

Fidget spinners became popular toys in April 2017, although similar devices had been invented as early as 1993.\\nThe toy has been promoted as helping people who have trouble focusing or those who fidget to relieve nervous energy, anxiety, or psychological stress. There are claims that a fidget spinner can help calm down people who have anxiety and other neurological disorders like ADHD and autism. However, as of May 2017, there is no scientific evidence that they are effective as a treatment for autism or ADHD.\\n\\nDesign\\nFidget spinners are toys not unlike yo-yo or other skill toys, designed to spin with little effort. A basic fidget spinner usually consists of a two- or three-pronged design with a bearing in its center circular pad. However, the number of prongs may vary - some may have six or more. A person holds the center pad while the toy spins. They are made from various materials including brass, stainless steel, titanium, copper, aluminium, and plastic. The bearings are generally ceramic, metal (stainless steel or chrome), and some are hybrids—such as ceramic balls with stainless races and cages. Each fidget spinner also has two or more weights on the outside that make it spin faster and stay balanced. Bearings can vary to adjust for the design\\'s spin time, vibration, and noise, causing unique sensory feedback.\\nBeing a kind of a flywheel of a gyroscope in principle, fidget spinners come with similar effects enabling a player to pull various tricks and stunts while forces of a gyroscope take hold. A fidget spinner can be balanced on top of fingers, thrown and caught, and so on.\\n\\nOrigin\\nAs of 2017, the patent status of the various fidget spinners on the market was unclear.\\nCatherine Hettinger, a chemical engineer by training, was initially credited by some news stories as having been the inventor of the fidget spinner, including by media outlets such as The Guardian, The New York Times, and the New York Post. Hettinger filed a patent application for a \"spinning toy\" in 1993 and a patent was issued, but Hettinger allowed the patent to lapse in 2005 after she could not find a commercial partner. A May 2017 Bloomberg News article showed that Hettinger was not the inventor of the fidget spinner, and Hettinger agreed.\\nIn an interview appearing on May 4, 2017 on NPR, Scott McCoskery described how he invented a metal spinning device in 2014 to cope with his own fidgeting in IT meetings and conference calls. In response to requests from an online community, he began selling the device he called the Torqbar online.\\n\\nMarketing and sales\\nWith the rapid increase in the popularity of fidget spinners in 2017, many children and teenagers began using them in school, and some schools also reported that kids were trading and selling the spinner toys.\\nAs a result of their frequent use by school children, many school districts banned the toy. Some teachers argued that the spinners distracted students from their schoolwork. According to a survey conducted by Alexi Roy and published in May 2017, 32% of the largest 200 American public and private high schools had banned spinners on campus.\\nWhen fidget spinners rose in popularity in 2017, many publications in the popular press discussed the marketing claims made about them for people with ADHD, autism, or anxiety.

Hochmair-Desoyer (born 1953) is an Austrian electrical engineer from Technical University of Vienna. She helped create the first micro-electronic multi-channel cochlear implant in the world with her husband Prof. Erwin Hochmair. In 1980 she co-founded together with Prof. Erwin Hochmair the medical device company MED-EL and serves as its CEO and CTO. In 2013, she was honored together with two more scientists with the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award for developing the modern cochlear implant.\\n\\nBiography\\nIngeborg Hochmair was born in 1953 in Vienna, Austria. Her mother was a physicist and her father was Dean of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at Vienna University of Technology. Her grandmother was one of the first female chemical engineers in Austria. She commenced her studies at Technical University of Vienna in electrical engineering in 1971 [and was the first woman to do her PhD (with distinction)in 1979]. Her dissertation was on the \"Technical realization and psychoacoustic evaluation of a system for multichannel chronic stimulation of the auditory nerve.\" From 1976 to 1986 she worked as Assistant Professor at the Institute of General Electrical Engineering and Electronics at Technical University of Vienna. She also worked at Stanford University’s Institute for Electronics in Medicine as a Visiting Associate Professor in 1979. Together with her husband she decided to move from Vienna to Innsbruck in 1986 where she taught (first as Assistant Professor and later as Associate Professor) at the Institute of Applied Physics Electronics of University of Innsbruck till 1999. In 1998 she achieved Venia Legendi (Univ. Doz.) in Biomedical Engineering at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering of Technical University of Vienna.\\nThe idea of creating a company to develop and manufacture hearing implants was put to effect in the early eighties when she co-founded together with her husband Erwin Hochmair the medical device company MED-EL. The first employees were hired in 1990 and mark the beginning of the company. Since 2000 she has founded and co-founded multiple companies linked to the area of hearing loss and hearing implants.\\n\\nHearing implant research & work\\nIn 1975 Ingeborg and Erwin Hochmair started the cochlear implant development at Technical University of Vienna with the overall goal of enabling the user not only to hear sounds but also to provide some speech understanding. Together they developed the world’s first microelectronic multi-channel cochlear implant. This implant included a long, flexible electrode, which could, for the first time, deliver electric signals to the auditory nerve along a large part of the cochlea, the snail-shaped inner ear. It had \"8 channels, a stimulation rate of 10.000 pulses per second per channel, 8 independent current sources, and a flexible electrode for 22-25mm insertion into the cochlea.\" The first device was implanted on 16 December 1977 in Vienna by Prof. Kurt Burian followed by a second implantation in March 1978. Despite an early shunt in the first patient and some existing tinnitus in the second patient, place pitch could be demonstrated and the second patient could reliably discriminate and identify stimulation channels.\\nWith a next version of this device modified for better signal transparency, the next milestone in cochlear implant development was reached in March 1980: the understanding of words and sentences without lip-reading in a quiet environment via a small, body-worn sound processor. Over the years, about 500 devices were implanted in adults and children. Owing to the implant’s very low power consumption and external processing, the world’s first behind-the-ear (BTE) processor for a cochlear implant was designed in 1991. It was called COMFORT.\\nAs CEO and CTO of MED-EL Ingeborg Hochmair has developed many world’s first products and solutions to cater to the demand of patients and surgeons worldwide for a broad spectrum of indications of hearing loss.\\n\\nPublications\\nIngeborg Hochmair has over 100 scientific publications in the field of Cochlear Implants, Medical Devices, Neuroprotheses, Audio & Speech Processing Technology.

She is under indictment by the United States Department of Justice for wire fraud. She is the founder and former CEO of Theranos, a privately held company known for its false claims to have devised revolutionary blood tests that used very small amounts of blood. In 2015, Forbes named Holmes as the youngest self-made female billionaire in the world due to a $9 billion valuation of Theranos. The next year Forbes revised the value of her interest in Theranos to zero dollars, given an updated $800 million valuation of Theranos and the fact that many of Theranos\\' investors hold preferred shares and so would be paid before Holmes (who holds common stock) in a liquidation event.\\nIn 2016, after a series of journalistic and regulatory investigations that questioned the veracity of Holmes\\' claims, federal prosecutors began criminal investigations for potentially misleading investors and the government about Theranos\\' blood-testing technology. Following the revelation of potential fraud, Fortune named Holmes one of the \"World\\'s Most Disappointing Leaders\". In 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) banned Holmes from owning, operating, or directing a diagnostic lab for a period of two years. In April 2017, Theranos announced that it had reached a global settlement agreement with CMS, under which CMS withdrew the revocation of the company’s Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments operating certificates and reduced its civil monetary penalty. In December 2017, Theranos settled a lawsuit brought by the State of Arizona alleging that the company had sold 1.5 million blood tests to Arizonans while concealing or misrepresenting important facts about those tests. The company agreed to pay $200,000 in civil fines, and refund the cost of the tests to Arizona consumers.\\nIn March 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Holmes and Theranos, accusing them of fraudulently raising more than $700 million from investors through false or exaggerated claims. In exchange for settling the charges, Holmes agreed to pay a $500,000 fine, return 18.9 million shares, relinquish her voting control of Theranos, and be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for ten years. At its height, Theranos had more than 800 employees; by April 2018, it had laid off the vast majority of its workforce and had fewer than two dozen employees remaining.\\nIn June 2018, a federal grand jury indicted Holmes and former Theranos COO Ramesh Balwani on nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Prosecutors allege that Holmes and Balwani engaged in two criminal schemes, one to defraud investors, the other to defraud doctors and patients. After the indictment, Theranos announced that Holmes would resign as CEO; she retains her position as chairwoman of the board.\\n\\nEarly life\\nHolmes was born in February 1984 in Washington, D.C.  Holmes\\' father, Christian Rasmus Holmes IV, worked in the United States, Africa, and China as part of government agencies such as USAID. Her mother, Noel Anne Daoust, worked as a Congressional committee staffer.\\nShe attended St. John\\'s School in Houston and was recognized for her \"tireless optimism and a particularly warm smile\". During high school, Holmes was interested in computer programming and started her first business selling C++ compilers to Chinese universities. In 2001, Holmes applied to Stanford University and was named a President\\'s Scholar, which came with a stipend to use on a research project. She studied chemical engineering and used the stipend to work in a lab with Ph.D. candidates and Channing Robertson, dean at the engineering school.\\nAfter the end of her freshman year, Holmes worked in a lab at the Genome Institute of Singapore on testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) through the collection of blood samples with syringes. She filed her first patent on a wearable drug-delivery patch in 2003. In March 2004, she dropped out of Stanford\\'s School of Engineering and used her tuition money as seed funding for a consumer healthcare technology company.\\n\\nTheranos\\nFounding of Theranos\\nHolmes founded the company in Palo Alto, California as Real-Time Cures to \"democratize healthcare.\" Her goal was to make health information accessible to all people at any time so that risk of disease and health conditions could be detected early on. Holmes describes her fear of needles as one of her motivations for founding Theranos. When Holmes initially pitched the idea to reap \"vast amounts of data from a few droplets of blood derived from the tip of a finger\" to several of her professors at Stanford including Phyllis Gardner, most of them said that it was \"virtually impossible to do so with any real efficacy\". However, Holmes succeeded in getting Robertson to back her idea.\\nIn April 2004, she incorporated the company as Theranos (a portmanteau of \"therapy\" and \"diagnosis\") and rented the basement of a group college house. At that time, Holmes hired her first employee and rented lab space. Robertson became the company\\'s first board member and introduced Holmes to venture capitalists.\\n\\nFunding and expansion\\nBy December 2004, she had raised $6 million to fund Theranos. The company\\'s first revenue came from contracts Holmes established with pharmaceutical companies to conduct testing and other clinical trials. By the end of 2010, Holmes had more than $92 million in venture capital for Theranos. In July 2011, Holmes was introduced to former Secretary of State George Shultz. After a two-hour meeting, he joined the Theranos board of directors. She was recognized for forming \"the most illustrious board in U.S. corporate history\" over the next three years. Holmes operated Theranos in stealth mode without press releases or a company website until September 2013 when the company announced a partnership with Walgreens to make in-store blood sample collection centers.\\nMedia attention increased in 2014 as she was on the cover of Fortune, Forbes, T: The New York Times Style Magazine and Inc.. Forbes recognized Holmes as the world\\'s youngest self-made female billionaire and ranked her #110 on the Forbes 400 in 2014. Theranos was valued at $9 billion with more than $400 million in venture capital. By the end of 2014, she had 18 U.S. patents and 66 foreign patents in her name.\\nDuring 2015, Holmes established agreements with Cleveland Clinic, Capital BlueCross and AmeriHealth Caritas to use Theranos technology.\\n\\nFalse claims, SEC settlement, and decline of company\\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in October 2015 that the Edison blood testing device by Theranos might provide inaccurate results. Holmes denied the claims and said the company would publish data on the accuracy of its tests.\\nIn January 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) sent a warning letter to Theranos after inspecting its Newark, California, laboratory. CMS regulators proposed a two-year ban on Holmes from owning or operating a blood lab after the company had not fixed problems within its California lab in March 2016. On The Today Show, Holmes said that she was \"devastated we did not catch and fix these issues faster\" and that the lab would be rebuilt with help from a new scientific and medical advisory board. In July 2016, the CMS banned Holmes from owning, operating, or directing a blood testing service for a period of two years. (The company appealed that decision to a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services appeals board.) Shortly thereafter, Walgreens ended its relationship with Theranos and closed its in-store blood collection centers. The FDA also ordered the company to cease using its Capillary Tube Nanotainer device.\\nOther reported ongoing actions include civil and criminal investigations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Attorney\\'s Office for the Northern District of California, an unspecified FBI investigation, and two class action fraud lawsuits. Holmes is reportedly standing by all of her company\\'s claims and has denied any wrongdoing. In April 2017, Theranos announced that it had reached a global settlement agreement with CMS, resolving all outstanding legal and regulatory proceedings.\\nOn May 16, 2017, approximately 99 percent of Theranos shareholders reached an agreement with the company to dismiss all current and potential litigation in exchange for shares of preferred stock. Holmes released a portion of her equity to offset any dilution of stock value to non-participating shareholders.\\nOn March 14, 2018, Holmes settled a SEC lawsuit. The charges of fraud included claiming the company\\'s technology was being used by the U.S. Department of Defense in combat situations despite never having been used (Defense Secretary Jim Mattis pushed for use of the technology although it was never implemented). Another false claim included claiming a $100 million revenue stream in 2014 that was actually $100,000. The terms of the settlement included surrendering voting control of Theranos, a ban on holding an officer position in a public company for 10 years, and a $500,000 fine.\\nAt its height, Theranos had more than 800 employees. It fired 340 staff members in October 2016, and an additional 155 employees in January 2017. By April 2018, it had laid off the vast majority of its workforce and had fewer than two dozen employees remaining. In April 2018, Theranos filed a WARN Act notice with the State of California announcing its plans to permanently lay off 105 employees.\\n\\nCriminal charges\\nOn June 15, 2018, following an investigation by the U.S. Attorney\\'s Office in San Francisco that lasted more than two years, a federal grand jury indicted Holmes and former Theranos COO and president Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani on nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Prosecutors allege that Holmes and Balwani engaged in two criminal schemes, one to defraud investors, the other to defraud doctors and patients. After the indictment was issued, Holmes stepped down as CEO of Theranos, but remained chair of the board.\\nThe case is proceeding in the U.S. District Court in San Jose. Holmes and Balwani pleaded not guilty.\\n\\nPromotional activities\\nHolmes partnered with Carlos Slim Helú in June 2015 to improve blood testing in Mexico. In October 2015, she announced #IronSisters to help women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) careers. She helped to draft and pass a law in Arizona to let people obtain and pay for lab tests without requiring insurance or healthcare provider approval.\\n\\nRecognition\\nHolmes was named one of Time magazine\\'s Most Influential People in the World in 2015. Holmes received the \"Under 30 Doers\" Award from Forbes and ranked on its 2015 list of the \"Most Powerful Women\". She was also named \"Woman of the Year\" by Glamour. Holmes was awarded the 2015 Horatio Alger Award, being the youngest recipient in its history. She had also previously been named Fortune\\'s \"Businessperson of the Year\" and \"40 Under 40\" lists.\\nFollowing several journalistic and criminal investigations and civil suits regarding Theranos\\' business practices, she was charged with \"massive fraud\" by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In 2016, Fortune named Holmes one of the \"World\\'s Most Disappointing Leaders\".\\n\\nPersonal life\\nPrior to the March 2018 settlement, Holmes held a 50 percent stock ownership in Theranos. Forbes listed her as one of \"America\\'s Richest Self-Made Women\" in 2015 with a net worth of $4.5 billion. In June 2016, Forbes released an updated valuation of $800 million for Theranos, which made Holmes’s stake essentially worthless, because other investors owned preferred shares and would have been paid before Holmes, who owned only common stock. Holmes reportedly owes a $25 million debt to Theranos in connection with exercising options. She did not receive any company cash from the arrangement, nor did she sell any of her shares, including those associated with the debt.\\nWSJ reports that Ms Holmes was romantically involved for several years, beginning 2005, with Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, an India-born Silicon Valley technology entrepreneur who also was Theranos\\' Chief Operating Officer between 2009 until she fired him in 2016.\\n\\nBad Blood: book and movie\\nIn May 2018 author John Carreyrou released his book Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup. A movie based on the book is in development with Jennifer Lawrence in the role of Holmes and to be directed by Adam McKay.\\n\\nSee also\\nAlbert Abrams – an inventor of a supposed diagnostic machine\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nElizabeth Holmes on IMDb\\nElizabeth Holmes: Lab testing reinvented.

It prevented system overloads by monitoring call center traffic and prioritizing tasks on phone switching systems to enable more robust service during peak calling times. At Bell Laboratories where she worked for over 32 years, Hoover was described as an important pioneer for women in the field of computer technology.\\n\\nEarly life\\nErna Schneider was born on June 19, 1926 in Irvington, New Jersey. Her family lived in South Orange, New Jersey and her father was a dentist and her mother was a teacher. She had a younger brother who died from polio at the age of five. She loved swimming, sailing, canoeing, and was interested in science at an early age. According to one source, she read the biography of Marie Curie which suggested to her that she could succeed in a scientific field despite the prevailing ideas about gender roles at the time. Hoover attended Wellesley College where she studied classical and medieval philosophy and history. She graduated from Wellesley in 1948 with honors, earning a bachelor\\'s degree, and she was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa and was honored as a Durant Scholar. She earned her Ph.D from Yale University in philosophy and foundations of mathematics in 1951.\\n\\nCareer\\nHoover was a professor at Swarthmore College from 1951-54 where she taught philosophy and logic. However, she had been unable to win a tenure-track position, possibly because of her gender and marital status, according to one view. In 1953, she married Charles Wilson Hoover, Jr., and he was very supportive of his wife\\'s career pursuits. In 1954, she joined Bell Labs as a senior technical associate, and was promoted in 1956. According to one source, the internal training program was the \"equivalent of a master\\'s degree in computer science.\" Switching systems were moving from electronic to computer-based technologies. Problems happened when a call center would be inundated with thousands of calls in a short amount of time, overwhelming the unreliable electronic relays, and causing the entire system to \"freeze up.\"\\nHoover used her knowledge of symbolic logic and feedback theory to program the control mechanisms of a call center to use data about incoming calls to impose order on the whole system. It used computer electronic methods to monitor the frequency of incoming calls at different times. Her method gave priority to processes that were concerned with the input and output of the switch over processes that were less important such as record keeping and billing. The computer, as a result, would adjust the call center\\'s acceptance rate automatically, greatly reducing the overloading problem. The system became known as stored program control.\\nHoover\\'s thinking about the invention happened while she was in a hospital recuperating after having given birth to her second daughter, according to several sources. Lawyers for Bell Labs handling the patent had to go to her house to visit her while she was on maternity leave so that she could sign the papers. The result of the invention was much more robust service to callers during peak load times:\\n\\nTo my mind it was kind of common sense ... I designed the executive program for handling situations when there are too many calls, to keep it operating efficiently without hanging up on itself. Basically it was designed to keep the machine from throwing up its hands and going berserk.\\n\\nFor her invention, termed Feedback Control Monitor for Stored Program Data Processing System, Hoover was awarded patent #3,623,007 in November 1971, one of the first software patents ever issued. The patent was applied for in 1967 and issued in 1971. As a result of her invention, she became the first woman supervisor of a technical department at Bell Labs. She headed the operations support department in 1987. The principles of her invention are still being used in telecommunications equipment in the 21st-century.\\nHoover worked on various high-level applications such as research radar control programs of the Safeguard Anti-Ballistic Missile System, which were systems to intercept incoming intercontinental ballistic missile warheads. Her department worked on artificial intelligence methods, large databases, and transactional software to support large telephone networks. She worked at Bell Labs for 32 years until retiring in 1987. In addition, she served on the boards of higher education organizations in New Jersey. As a member of the board of Trustees of The College of New Jersey, she was described as a visionary who was instrumental in increasing women faculty as well as enrolling the \"best prepared high school graduates\" in the state, and she helped build the college into a respected institution of higher education by lobbying extensively for state funding.\\n\\nAwards\\nShe was awarded one of the first patents for computer software. She was elected as a member of the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2008. She received the Wellesley College alumni achievement award.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nhttp://lemelson.mit.edu/resources/erna-schneider-hoover\\nBiography of Hoover from IEEE'), (1110, 'Grace Brewster Murray Hopper (née Murray; December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992) was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first compiler related tools. She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today.\\nHopper had attempted to enlist in the Navy during World War II, but she was rejected by the military because she was 34 years of age and thus too old to enlist. She instead joined the Navy Reserves. Hopper began her computing career in 1944 when she worked on the Harvard Mark I team that was led by Howard H. Aiken. In 1949, she joined the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation and was part of the development team that designed the UNIVAC I computer. It was at Eckert–Mauchly that she began developing the compiler. She believed that computer code could be written in English by using a programming language that was based on English words. The compiler would convert that code into machine code that would be understood by computers. By 1952, Hopper finished her program linker (originally called a compiler), which was written for the A-0 System.\\nIn 1954, Eckert–Mauchly chose Hopper to lead their department for automatic programming, and she led the release of some of the first compiled languages like FLOW-MATIC. In 1959, she participated in the CODASYL consortium, which consulted Hopper to guide them in creating a machine-independent programming language. This led to the COBOL language, which was inspired by her idea of a language being based on English words. In 1966, she retired from the Naval Reserve, but in 1967, the Navy recalled her to active duty. She retired from the Navy in 1986 and found work as a consultant for the Digital Equipment Corporation, sharing her computing experiences.\\nOwing to her accomplishments and her naval rank, she was sometimes referred to as \"Amazing Grace\". The U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Hopper was named for her, as was the Cray XE6 \"Hopper\" supercomputer at NERSC. During her lifetime, Hopper was awarded 40 honorary degrees from universities across the world. A college at Yale University is named in her honor. In 1991, she received the National Medal of Technology. On November 22, 2016, she was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.\\n\\nEarly life and education\\nHopper was born in New York City. She was the eldest of three children. Her parents, Walter Fletcher Murray and Mary Campbell Van Horne, were of Scottish and Dutch descent, and attended West End Collegiate Church. Her great-grandfather, Alexander Wilson Russell, an admiral in the US Navy, fought in the Battle of Mobile Bay during the Civil War.\\nGrace was very curious as a child; this was a lifelong trait. At the age of seven, she decided to determine how an alarm clock worked and dismantled seven alarm clocks before her mother realized what she was doing (she was then limited to one clock). For her preparatory school education, she attended the Hartridge School in Plainfield, New Jersey. Hopper was initially rejected for early admission to Vassar College at age 16 (her test scores in Latin were too low), but she was admitted the following year. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Vassar in 1928 with a bachelor\\'s degree in mathematics and physics and earned her master\\'s degree at Yale University in 1930.\\nIn 1934, she earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale under the direction of Øystein Ore. Her dissertation, New Types of Irreducibility Criteria, was published that same year. Hopper began teaching mathematics at Vassar in 1931, and was promoted to associate professor in 1941.\\nShe was married to New York University professor Vincent Foster Hopper (1906–76) from 1930 until their divorce in 1945. She did not marry again, but chose to retain his surname.\\n\\nCareer\\nWorld War II\\nHopper had tried to enlist in the Navy early in World War II. She was rejected for multiple reasons. At age 34, she was too old to enlist, and her weight to height ratio was too low. She was also denied on the basis that her job as a mathematician and mathematics professor at Vassar College was valuable to the war effort. During the war in 1943, Hopper obtained a leave of absence from Vassar and was sworn into the United States Navy Reserve; she was one of many women who volunteered to serve in the WAVES. She had to get an exemption to enlist; she was 15 pounds (6.8 kg) below the Navy minimum weight of 120 pounds (54 kg). She reported in December and trained at the Naval Reserve Midshipmen\\'s School at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. Hopper graduated first in her class in 1944, and was assigned to the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard University as a lieutenant, junior grade. She served on the Mark I computer programming staff headed by Howard H. Aiken. Hopper and Aiken co-authored three papers on the Mark I, also known as the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator. Hopper\\'s request to transfer to the regular Navy at the end of the war was declined due to her advanced age of 38. She continued to serve in the Navy Reserve. Hopper remained at the Harvard Computation Lab until 1949, turning down a full professorship at Vassar in favor of working as a research fellow under a Navy contract at Harvard.\\n\\nUNIVAC\\nIn 1949, Hopper became an employee of the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation as a senior mathematician and joined the team developing the UNIVAC I. Hopper also served as UNIVAC director of Automatic Programming Development for Remington Rand. The UNIVAC was the first known large-scale electronic computer to be on the market in 1950, and was more competitive at processing information than the Mark I.\\nWhen Hopper recommended the development of a new programming language that would use entirely English words, she \"was told very quickly that [she] couldn\\'t do this because computers didn\\'t understand English.\" Her idea was not accepted for 3 years, and she published her first paper on the subject, compilers, in 1952. In the early 1950s, the company was taken over by the Remington Rand corporation, and it was while she was working for them that her original compiler work was done. The program was known as the A compiler and its first version was A-0.\\nIn 1952 she had an operational link-loader, which at the time was referred to as a compiler. She later said that \"Nobody believed that,\" and that she \"had a running compiler and nobody would touch it. They told me computers could only do arithmetic.\" She goes on to say that her compiler \"translated mathematical notation into machine code. Manipulating symbols was fine for mathematicians but it was no good for data processors who were not symbol manipulators. Very few people are really symbol manipulators. If they are they become professional mathematicians, not data processors. It\\'s much easier for most people to write an English statement than it is to use symbols. So I decided data processors ought to be able to write their programs in English, and the computers would translate them into machine code. That was the beginning of COBOL, a computer language for data processors. I could say \"Subtract income tax from pay\" instead of trying to write that in octal code or using all kinds of symbols. COBOL is the major language used today in data processing.\"\\nIn 1954 Hopper was named the company\\'s first director of automatic programming, and her department released some of the first compiler-based programming languages, including MATH-MATIC and FLOW-MATIC.\\n\\nCOBOL\\nIn the spring of 1959, computer experts from industry and government were brought together in a two-day conference known as the Conference on Data Systems Languages (CODASYL). Hopper served as a technical consultant to the committee, and many of her former employees served on the short-term committee that defined the new language COBOL (an acronym for COmmon Business-Oriented Language). The new language extended Hopper\\'s FLOW-MATIC language with some ideas from the IBM equivalent, COMTRAN. Hopper\\'s belief that programs should be written in a language that was close to English (rather than in machine code or in languages close to machine code, such as assembly languages) was captured in the new business language, and COBOL went on to be the most ubiquitous business language to date. Among the members of the committee that worked on COBOL was Mount Holyoke College alumnus Jean E. Sammet.\\nFrom 1967 to 1977, Hopper served as the director of the Navy Programming Languages Group in the Navy\\'s Office of Information Systems Planning and was promoted to the rank of captain in 1973. She developed validation software for COBOL and its compiler as part of a COBOL standardization program for the entire Navy.\\n\\nStandards\\nIn the 1970s, Hopper advocated for the Defense Department to replace large, centralized systems with networks of small, distributed computers. Any user on any computer node could access common databases located on the network. She developed the implementation of standards for testing computer systems and components, most significantly for early programming languages such as FORTRAN and COBOL. The Navy tests for conformance to these standards led to significant convergence among the programming language dialects of the major computer vendors. In the 1980s, these tests (and their official administration) were assumed by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), known today as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).\\n\\nRetirement\\nIn accordance with Navy attrition regulations, Hopper retired from the Naval Reserve with the rank of commander at age 60 at the end of 1966. She was recalled to active duty in August 1967 for a six-month period that turned into an indefinite assignment. She again retired in 1971 but was again asked to return to active duty in 1972. She was promoted to captain in 1973 by Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt, Jr.\\nAfter Republican Representative Philip Crane saw her on a March 1983 segment of 60 Minutes, he championed H.J.Res. 341, a joint resolution originating in the House of Representatives, which led to her promotion to commodore by special Presidential appointment. She remained on active duty for several years beyond mandatory retirement by special approval of Congress. Effective November 8, 1985, the rank of commodore was renamed rear admiral (lower half) and Hopper became one of the Navy\\'s few female admirals.\\nFollowing a career that spanned more than 42 years, Admiral Hopper took mandatory retirement from the Navy on August 14, 1986. At a celebration held in Boston on the USS Constitution to commemorate her retirement, Hopper was awarded the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, the highest non-combat decoration awarded by the Department of Defense.\\nAt the time of her retirement, she was the oldest active-duty commissioned officer in the United States Navy (79 years, eight months and five days), and had her retirement ceremony aboard the oldest commissioned ship in the United States Navy (188 years, nine months and 23 days). (Admirals William D. Leahy, Chester W. Nimitz, Hyman G. Rickover and Charles Stewart were the only other officers in the Navy\\'s history to serve on active duty at a higher age. Leahy and Nimitz served on active duty for life due to their promotions to the rank of fleet admiral.)\\n\\nPost retirement\\nFollowing her retirement from the Navy, she was hired as a senior consultant to Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). Hopper was initially offered the job position by Rita Yavinsky, but she insisted on applying for the position at DEC, and going through the typical formal interview process. She also sent a letter to Yavinsky\\'s boss explaining that she would be available on alternating Thursdays, receiving a high salary, and have access to an unlimited expense account if she were to be exhibited at their museum of computing as a pioneer. After the proposal from Hopper, she was hired as a full-time senior consultant. As part of her position, she would report to Yavinsky. In this position, Hopper represented the company at industry forums, serving on various industry committees, along with other obligations. She retained that position until her death at age 85 in 1992.\\nHopper was a goodwill ambassador in her primary activity in this capacity. She lectured widely about the early days of computing, her career, and on efforts that computer vendors could take to make life easier for their users. She visited most of Digital\\'s engineering facilities, where she generally received a standing ovation at the conclusion of her remarks.\\nShe often recounted that during her service she was frequently asked by admirals and generals why satellite communication would take so long. So during many of her lectures, she illustrated a nanosecond using salvaged obsolete Bell System 25 pair telephone cable, cut it to 11.8  inch (30  cm) lengths, the distance that light travels in one nanosecond, and handed out the individual wires to her listeners. Although no longer a serving officer, she always wore her Navy full dress uniform to these lectures (which is not allowed under U.S. Department of Defense regulation 32 CFR 53.2(a)(1)).\\n\\nThe most important thing I\\'ve accomplished, other than building the compiler, is training young people. They come to me, you know, and say, \\'Do you think we can do this?\\' I say, \"Try it.\" And I back \\'em up. They need that. I keep track of them as they get older and I stir \\'em up at intervals so they don\\'t forget to take chances.\\n\\nAnecdotes\\nThroughout much of her later career, Hopper was much in demand as a speaker at various computer-related events. She was well known for her lively and irreverent speaking style, as well as a rich treasury of early war stories. She also received the nickname \"Grandma COBOL\".\\nWhile she was working on a Mark II Computer at Harvard University in 1947, her associates discovered a moth that was stuck in a relay; the moth impeded the operation of the relay. While neither Hopper nor her crew mentioned the phrase \"debugging\" in their logs, the case was held as an instance of literal \"debugging.\" For many years, the term bug had been in use in engineering. The remains of the moth can be found in the group\\'s log book at the Smithsonian Institution\\'s National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.\\nGrace Hopper is famous for her nanoseconds visual aid. People (such as generals and admirals) used to ask her why satellite communication took so long. She started handing out pieces of wire that were just under one foot long (11.80 inches = 300 millimeters)—the distance that light travels in one nanosecond. She gave these pieces of wire the metonym \"nanoseconds.\" She was careful to tell her audience that the length of her nanoseconds was actually the maximum speed the signals would travel in a vacuum, and that signals would travel more slowly through the actual wires that were her teaching aids. Later she used the same pieces of wire to illustrate why computers had to be small to be fast. At many of her talks and visits, she handed out \"nanoseconds\" to everyone in the audience, contrasting them with a coil of wire 984 feet long, representing a microsecond. Later, while giving these lectures while working for DEC, she passed out packets of pepper, calling the individual grains of ground pepper picoseconds.\\nJay Elliot described Grace Hopper as appearing to be \"\\'all Navy\\', but when you reach inside, you find a \\'Pirate\\' dying to be released\".\\n\\nDeath\\nOn New Year\\'s Day 1992, Hopper died in her sleep of natural causes at her home in Arlington, Virginia; she was 85 years of age. She was interred with full military honors in Arlington National Cemetery.\\n\\nDates of rank\\nEnsign - December 1943\\nLieutenant (junior grade) - June 27, 1944\\nLieutenant - January 1, 1946\\nLieutenant Commander - April 1, 1952\\nCommander - July 1, 1957\\nRetired - December 31, 1966\\nRecalled to active duty - August 1967\\nRetired - 1971\\nRecalled to active duty - 1972\\nCaptain - August 2, 1973\\nCommodore - December 15, 1983\\nRear Admiral (Lower Half) - November 8, 1985\\nFinal retirement - August 31, 1986\\n\\nAwards and honors\\nMilitary awards\\nOther awards\\n1964: Hopper was awarded the Society of Women Engineers Achievement Award, the Society\\'s highest honor, \"In recognition of her significant contributions to the burgeoning computer industry as an engineering manager and originator of automatic programming systems.\".\\n1969: Hopper was awarded the inaugural Data Processing Management Association Man of the Year award (now called the Distinguished Information Sciences Award).\\n1971: The annual Grace Murray Hopper Award for Outstanding Young Computer Professionals was established in 1971 by the Association for Computing Machinery.\\n1973: First American and the first woman of any nationality to be made a Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society.\\n1982: American Association of University Women Achievement Award and an Honorary Doctor of Science from Marquette University.\\n1985: Honorary Doctor of Letters from Western New England College (now Western New England University).\\n1986: Upon her retirement, she received the Defense Distinguished Service Medal.\\n1987: The first Computer History Museum Fellow Award Recipient \"for contributions to the development of programming languages, for standardization efforts, and for lifelong naval service.\"\\n1988: Golden Gavel Award at the Toastmasters International convention in Washington, DC.\\n1991: National Medal of Technology.\\n1991: Elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\\n1996: USS Hopper (DDG-70) was launched.

She experienced great demand for her invention from friends, particularly other army mothers. Initially, the big manufacturers were unable to see the commercial possibilities of disposable nappies though, and Valerie made over 400 PADDIs herself using her sewing machine at the kitchen table. She sold these for 5 shillings each. Latterly, the then newly created material PVC was used for the garment.\\nValerie applied for the patent in April 1948, which was later granted for the PADDI garment in the UK in October 1949, but not for the disposal pad inserts. Valerie unsuccessfully approached several companies for help to make the product on a larger commercial scale. A chance meeting between Valerie\\'s father, Vincent Ziani de Ferranti, and Sir Robert Robinson at a Royal Society dinner then led to her signing a contract with Robinson & Sons of Chesterfield on 8 November 1949.\\nIn 1950, Boots agreed to sell PADDI in all their branches. In 1951 the PADDI patent was granted for the US and worldwide. The PADDI was displayed at the Mothercraft Exhibition in Westminster in 1950, and then at the Ideal Home Exhibition in 1952. The BBC featured the invention as one of the six most interesting products at the show, and 750,000 packs had been sold by the end of that year. Shortly after that, Playtex and several other large international companies tried unsuccessfully to buy out Robinson & Sons. PADDI sales reached 6 million by 1960, and the product was very successful for many years until the advent of Pamper\\'s all-in-one diapers, in which plastic is thrown out together with the wadding, a concept which has been criticised by environmental groups as unsustainable.\\n\\nThe Nikini sanitary towel system\\nFollowing the success of the PADDI, Valerie went on to have three more children and relocate to Beauly when her Scottish husband Patrick Hunter Gordon joined his father Samuel Hunter Gordon in running the family engineering business AI Welders in Inverness. From there, she travelled back and forth to the Robinsons headquarters, where she developed the PADDI design and designed other products. She also created the Nikini sanitary towel system for women, the pad for which may be considered the world\\'s first modern sanitary towel. Rather to her surprise Nikini earned more royalties overall than Paddi, though as she reflected, “there are probably more menstruating women in the world than incontinent babies.”\\n\\nPersonal life\\nValerie Hunter Gordon was the granddaughter of inventor Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti, the founder of British electrical engineering firm Ferranti, great-granddaughter of Italian classical guitarist and composer Marco Aurelio Zani de Ferranti and the sister of Basil de Ferranti. Her maternal grandmother, Juliana Scott, was a concert pianist.\\nValerie married the decorated Royal Engineer, Major Patrick Hunter Gordon. She died on 19 October 2016 at the age of 94 and was survived by six children, 19 grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren.\\n\\n\\n== References =='), (1112, 'Ida Henrietta Hyde (September 8, 1857 – August 22, 1945) was an American physiologist known for developing a micro-electrode powerful enough to stimulate tissue chemically or electronically, yet small enough to inject or remove tissue from a cell. Ida was never married and agnostic in her religious standing. She retired at the age in 63 in the year 1920. After her retirement, Ida traveled to several places, including Switzerland, Austria, Egypt, India, and several locations in Germany. On August 22, 1945 Ida Hyde died of a cerebral hemorrhage.\\n\\nChildhood\\nBorn in Davenport, Iowa, Ida was one of four children to Meyer and Babette (Lowenthal) Heidenheimer, German immigrants from Württemberg. The surname Hyde was taken after their arrival in the United States. Ida\\'s father was a merchant that worked out of home and who left the family on one of his trips, leaving Babette to care for the children. In order to keep the family afloat, they moved to Chicago, where Babette took in jobs of cleaning and mending until she was able to start a prosperous business.All of the children were able and sent to public school and became educated middle class individuals, with the intention of Ida’s only brother Ben, to attend university.\\nIn 1871, the family home was destroyed in the Great Fire of Chicago, which destroyed the family business as well. Without any form of income, Ida as the oldest daughter, entered the work force at age 14 as a milliner\\'s apprentice. Because of her age, older than that of her siblings, much of the burden of supporting the family fell on her. She brought in a large portion of the family income, and even paid for her only brother\\'s education at the University of Illinois. Over time, she rose in her occupation to the job of saleslady. Her experience in the clothing store proved to be valuable later in life because of her ability to fashion her own clothing with minimal supplies.\\n\\nEducation\\nAt the store where she worked, Hyde chanced upon an English version of Ansichten der Natur (View of Nature) by Alexander von Humboldt. It was from this work that her love of biology was born. In addition, it spurred her toward continuing her education, which she did by attending night classes at the Chicago Athenaeum during 1875–76 in spite of her parent\\'s objections. Her further educational studies came to her while she was visiting her brother at his university and chanced upon meeting several women working in academia. She was able to pass her entrance exams for the College Preparatory School and later entered the same university as her brother.\\nIda began studying at the University of Illinois at the age of 24, but her study was cut short when her brother became sick in 1882 and she had to attend to him. She also used all of her savings for just one year of education. However, she passed the county teacher\\'s exam and, three years later, the Chicago teacher\\'s exams, and for the next seven years she worked as a teacher of second- and third-graders within the Chicago public school system. Her biological pursuits still were still expressed in her attempts to work nature studies into the public school system. She saved money to put towards her tuition, remaining focused on her goal of attaining a college degree.\\nIn 1888 she was finally able to return to the collegiate scene at the age of 31. She enrolled at Cornell University and earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in just three years. She was then offered a biology scholarship at Bryn Mawr College. She accepted and began under the tutelage of Jacques Loeb and Thomas Hunt Morgan. As an assistant att Woods Hole Biological Laboratory, she conducted research on the nervous system of jellyfish. She produced many detailed drawings and descriptions of the nerve cells. In 1893, Hyde received a European Fellowship from the Association of Collegiate Alumnae, which would later become the American Association of University Women.\\nIda’s results from the research at Woods Hole is said to have helped motivate Dr. Goette in inviting her to come to University of Strasbourg in 1893, to work with him even as no woman had done previously. Hyde, during her attendance at Strasbourg, was the first woman in Germany to have ever petitioned to matriculate for an advanced degree in natural science or mathematics. At the time it was necessary to petition the government and get permission from the faculty. Before this process went fully into motion Ida withdrew her attempts. It is said that the large number of people who spoke out against Ida going through with the petition is what was the cause of that decision, and that Heidelberg University would be a better place to gain her degree.\\nIda received her Ph.D. at Heidelberg University, Germany at age 39 after many frustrating obstacles presented because of her gender. She was required to go beyond the work of an average student to receive her degree, and became the third woman to graduate with a doctorate there. The main problem in obtaining her degree was that her teaching professor, Wilhelm Kühne, disliked the thought of allowing a woman to work under him. But her accomplishments eventually surmounted his opposition and she passed the doctoral examinations with honor in February 1896 and became the first woman to receive a doctorate from this institution. Her thesis project examined the physiological development of jellyfish (Hydromedusa).\\nIda researched at several other institutions before going to the University of Kansas including University of Berne 1896, and Radcliffe College 1897. After she started working at KU, Hyde also studied at Rush Medical College over several summers to receive her M. D. in 1911.\\n\\nCareer\\nIn the course of Ida’s seven years of teaching she was involved in establishing the “Science in the Schools” program in Chicago’s public school system. This program helped to introduce Nature Studies into these school, where Ida was even known for sharing her own teaching methods with the other educators.\\nFollowing completion of her doctorate, she was invited to Naples, Italy as the Investigator of Residence at the Naples Zoological Station, a prestigious post. She continued work on marine invertebrate physiology, until moving to the University of Bern, Switzerland to work with Dr. Kronecker on muscle physiology. She became the first woman admitted to do research at Harvard Medical School under W.T. Porter. While continuing her research, she also furthered her education and medical training at Harvard. Hyde remained an educator as well, teaching classes at preparatory schools and at Woods Hole during the summer.\\nShe was hired as an Associate Professor by the University of Kansas in 1899 and founded the Department of Physiology, also serving as its first Chairman of the Department of Physiology, where she worked for 22 years.\\nOver her career, Hyde\\'s research covered the nervous, circulatory, and respiratory systems of vertebrates and invertebrates, and explored the effects of narcotics, caffeine, and alcohol on the body. Also in through the course of her work she noted the differences in the effects of music on the cardiovascular system in athletes, musicians, and farmers and caffeine being the cause of decreased efficiency in physical work. She was the first women elected into the American Society of Physiologists in 1902, and was its only female member until 1913.\\n\\nMicroelectrode\\nHyde was a researcher and professor, but also an inventor and innovator. She developed instruments for monitoring physiological parameters in a marine animal that could be used in seawater. Her most well-known invention was an intracellular micropippette electrode. Dr. Hyde had observed that electrolytes in high concentrations affect processes of cell division, leading to her noting of the minute differences in electrical potential within cells. In order to understand how these nerve and muscle cells work, she needed to be able to stimulate the cells properly and be able to record the results of the change in the currents of the individual cells occurring. Ida’s microelectrode can be used for stimulating cells at the micro level while recording electrical activity within the cell without disturbing the cellular wall. This device was a revolutionary invention in neurophysiology and the study of contractile nerve tissue, however, the micro electrode was never officially attributed to Ida as being its first inventor.\\nThough Dr. Hyde’s possible microelectrode invention was reported in 1921, several others also created electrodes similar to Ida’s, while scientific historians, like G. Kass-Simon have accredited Hyde’s invention as being the original and revolutionary. Another microelectrode was supposedly invented another time, about twenty years after Ida was said to have made her version of this invention, by Judith Graham and Ralph W. Gerard from the University of Chicago. Then in the 1950s, Gerard was nominated for a Nobel Prize, because of his developed model of the microelectrode.\\n\\nSelected publications\\nNotes on the Hearts of Certain Mammals.

Though she was not a true medical professional, she was elected to membership in the Kansas Medical Society because of her expertise in the knowledge and control of infectious diseases. And in 1918 she was appointed State Chairman of the Kansas Women’s Committee on Health, Sanitation and National Defense. A notable proportion of the lectures Ida held in her career were on hygiene and spreadable diseases. Dr. Hyde spoke openly about human sexuality and its involvement in the spread of disease, as well as being an open promoter of public health education.\\n\\nConfronting Discrimination of Women\\nIt was not until I had worked many days in the splendid laboratory assigned to my private use that it dawned upon me that I was occupying a unique position... In the university circle the news quickly spread that an American \"woman\\'s rights\" freak... had had the boldness and audacity to force entrance into the college halls. -- Ida H. Hyde, \"Before Women Were Human Beings\".\\n\\nHyde repeatedly encountered barriers to her education and career due to her gender, and pressed for more equal access and treatment of women in academia throughout her life. When she was denied the right to enroll in Strassburg University because of her gender, she went to Heidelberg University. Although she was allowed to matriculate, the university\\'s medical school did not permit women, and the faculty denied her entry to physiology lectures or laboratories. Fortunately, her male colleagues shared their lecture notes, and after intense study she passed her doctoral examinations with honor. She wrote about her difficulties in a revealing account in the AAUW Journal entitled \"Before Women Were Human Beings\".\\nAfter returning to America, Hyde enlisted the help of many fellow women academics and wealthy female benefactors to create a fund to support women in science. The Naples Table Association became a source of both financial aid and professional support for women in scientific research, with 36 women benefiting from the program. In 1927, she established a scholarship at the University of Kansas (KU) for women pursuing careers in the sciences, and endowed the Ida H. Hyde International Fellowship with the Association of American University Women (AAUW). On the campus of KU, she pushed for toilet facilities in the science buildings; these buildings were built with only restrooms provided for men, assuming there would be no need for women\\'s facilities. She repeatedly pressed the university for equal pay and worked in the community to increase the opportunities for women in diverse professions.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nEncyclopedia of World Biography on Ida Henrietta Hyde\\nBiography From Answers.com\\nTucker, Gail (1981). \"Ida Henrietta Hyde: The First Woman Member of the Society\" (PDF).

She was a prominent thinker of the Neoplatonic school in Alexandria, where she taught philosophy and astronomy. She is the first female mathematician whose life is reasonably well recorded.\\nHypatia was renowned in her own lifetime as a great teacher and a wise counselor. Although no writings directly written by her have survived, it is thought that she may have edited the surviving text of Ptolemy\\'s Almagest and possibly co-written some of the commentaries attributed to her father, Theon of Alexandria. She also wrote a commentary on Diophantus\\'s thirteen-volume Arithmetica, which may survive in part, having been interpolated into Diophantus\\'s original text, and another commentary on Apollonius of Perga\\'s treatise on conic sections, which has not survived. She is known to have constructed astrolabes and hydrometers, but did not invent either of these, which were both in use long before she was born. Although she herself was a pagan, she was tolerant towards Christians and taught many Christian students, including Synesius, the future bishop of Ptolemais. Towards the end of her life, Hypatia advised Orestes, the Roman prefect of Alexandria, who was in the midst of a feud with Cyril, the bishop of Alexandria. Rumors spread accusing her of preventing Orestes from reconciling with Cyril and, in March 415 AD, she was murdered by a mob of Christian monks known as the parabalani under the leadership of a lector named Peter.\\nHypatia\\'s death shocked the empire and transformed her into a \"martyr for philosophy\", leading future Neoplatonists such as Damascius to become increasingly fervent in their opposition to Christianity. During the Middle Ages, Hypatia was co-opted as a symbol of Christian virtue and scholars believe she was part of the basis for the legend of Saint Catherine of Alexandria. During the Age of Enlightenment, she became a symbol of opposition to Catholicism. In the nineteenth century, European literature, especially Charles Kingsley\\'s 1853 novel Hypatia, romanticized her as \"the last of the Hellenes\". In the twentieth century, Hypatia became seen as an icon for women\\'s rights and a precursor to the feminist movement. Since the late twentieth century, some portrayals have associated Hypatia\\'s death with the burning of the Library of Alexandria, despite the historical fact that the library no longer existed during Hypatia\\'s lifetime.\\n\\nLife\\nUpbringing\\nHypatia was the daughter of the mathematician Theon of Alexandria (c. 335 – c. 405 AD). According to classical historian Edward J. Watts, Theon was the head of a school called the \"Mouseion\", which was named in emulation of the Hellenistic Mouseion, whose membership had ceased in the 260s AD. Theon\\'s school was exclusive, highly prestigious, and doctrinally conservative. Theon rejected the teachings of Iamblichus and may have taken pride in teaching a pure, Plotinian Neoplatonism. Although he was widely seen as a great mathematician at the time, Theon\\'s mathematical work has been deemed by modern standards as essentially \"minor\", \"trivial\", and \"completely unoriginal\". His primary achievement was the production of a new edition of Euclid\\'s Elements, in which he corrected scribal errors that had been made over the course of nearly 700 years of copying. Theon\\'s edition of Euclid\\'s Elements became the most widely-used edition of the textbook for centuries and almost totally supplanted all other editions.\\nNothing whatsoever is known about Hypatia\\'s mother, who is never mentioned in any of the extant sources. Theon dedicates his commentary on Book IV of Ptolemy\\'s Almagest to an individual named Epiphanius, addressing him as \"my dear son\", indicating that he may have been Hypatia\\'s brother, but the Greek word Theon uses (teknon) does not always mean \"son\" in the biological sense and was often used merely to signal strong feelings of paternal connection. Hypatia\\'s exact year of birth is still under debate, with suggested dates ranging from 350 to 370 AD. Many scholars have followed Richard Hoche in inferring that Hypatia was born around 370. According to a description of Hypatia from the lost work Life of Isidore by the Neoplatonist historian Damascius (c. 458 – c. 538), preserved in the entry for her in the Suda, a tenth-century Byzantine encyclopedia, Hypatia flourished during the reign of Arcadius. Hoche reasoned that Damascius\\'s description of her physical beauty would imply that she was at most 30 at that time, and the year 370 was 30 years prior to the midpoint of Arcadius\\'s reign. In contrast, theories that she was born as early as 350 are based on the wording of the chronicler John Malalas (c.\\u2009491 – 578), who calls her old at the time of her death in 415. Robert Penella argues that both theories are weakly based, and that her birth date should be left unspecified.\\n\\nCareer\\nHypatia was a Neoplatonist, but, like her father, she rejected the teachings of Iamblichus and instead embraced the original Neoplatonism formulated by Plotinus. The Alexandrian school was renowned at the time for its philosophy and Alexandria was regarded as second only to Athens as the philosophical capital of the Greco-Roman world. Hypatia taught students from all over the Mediterranean. According to Damascius, she lectured on the writings of Plato and Aristotle. He also states that she walked through Alexandria in a tribon, a kind of cloak associated with philosophers, giving impromptu public lectures.\\n\\nAccording to Watts, two main varieties of Neoplatonism were taught in Alexandria during the late fourth century. The first was the overtly pagan religious Neoplatonism taught at the Serapeum, which was greatly influenced by the teachings of Iamblichus. The second variety was the more moderate and less polemical variety championed by Hypatia and her father Theon, which was based on the teachings of Plotinus. Although Hypatia herself was a pagan, she was tolerant of Christians. In fact, every one of her known students was Christian. One of her most prominent pupils was Synesius of Cyrene, who went on to become a bishop of Ptolemais (now in eastern Libya) in 410. Afterward, he continued to exchange letters with Hypatia and his extant letters are the main sources of information about her career. Seven letters by Synesius to Hypatia have survived, but none from her addressed to him are extant. In a letter written in around 395 to his friend Herculianus, Synesius describes Hypatia as \"... a person so renowned, her reputation seemed literally incredible. We have seen and heard for ourselves she who honorably presides over the mysteries of philosophy.\"\\nThe Christian historian Socrates of Constantinople, a contemporary of Hypatia, describes her in his Ecclesiastical History:\\n\\nThere was a woman at Alexandria named Hypatia, daughter of the philosopher Theon, who made such attainments in literature and science, as to far surpass all the philosophers of her own time. Having succeeded to the school of Plato and Plotinus, she explained the principles of philosophy to her auditors, many of whom came from a distance to receive her instructions. On account of the self-possession and ease of manner which she had acquired in consequence of the cultivation of her mind, she not infrequently appeared in public in the presence of the magistrates. Neither did she feel abashed in going to an assembly of men. For all men on account of her extraordinary dignity and virtue admired her the more.\\n\\nPhilostorgius, another Christian historian, who was also a contemporary of Hypatia, states that she excelled her father in mathematics and the lexicographer Hesychius of Alexandria records that, like her father, she was also an extraordinarily talented astronomer. Damascius writes that Hypatia was \"exceedingly beautiful and fair of form\", but nothing else is known regarding her physical appearance and no ancient depictions of her have survived. Damascius states that Hypatia remained a lifelong virgin and that, when one of the men who came to her lectures tried to court her, she tried to sooth his lust by playing the lyre. When he refused to abandon his pursuit, she rejected him outright, displaying her bloody menstrual rags and declaring \"This is what you really love, my young man, but you do not love beauty for its own sake.\" Damascius further relates that the young man was so traumatized that he abandoned his desires for her immediately.\\nMichael A. B. Deakin, a historian of mathematics, argues that Hypatia\\'s menstruation was proof of her celibacy, since, in ancient times, menarche generally occurred around the time a woman reached marriageable age, much later than in developed countries today, and, since no reliable methods of birth control existed, menstruation would have actually been a relatively rare occurrence for any woman who was not devoted to a life of celibacy. Charlotte Booth, a British Egyptologist, rejects this assertion as unfounded, stating that Pharaonic texts make reference to amenorrhea, the unusual absence of menstruation in a woman of the proper age, and that Egyptian homes from the Hellenistic Period onwards had rooms under the stairs called \"women\\'s spaces\" that were specially designated for women to stay while they were menstruating. Both of these would be inexplicable if menstruation was indeed \"rare\". Booth therefore regards Hypatia\\'s menstruation, not as evidence of her celibacy, but rather of her \"femininity and even fertility.\"\\n\\nDeath\\nBackground\\nFrom 382 – 412, the bishop of Alexandria was Theophilus. Theophilus was militantly opposed to Iamblichean Neoplatonism and, in 391, he demolished the Serapeum. Despite this, Theophilus tolerated Hypatia\\'s school and seems to have regarded Hypatia as his ally. Theophilus supported the bishopric of Hypatia\\'s pupil Synesius, who describes Theophilus in his letters with love and admiration. Theophilus also permitted Hypatia herself to establish close relationships with the Roman prefects and other prominent political leaders. Partly as a result of Theophilus\\'s tolerance, Hypatia became extremely popular with the people of Alexandria and exerted profound political influence.\\nTheophilus died unexpectedly in 412. He had been training his nephew Cyril, but had not officially named him as his successor. A violent power struggle over the diocese broke out between Cyril and his rival Timothy. Cyril won and immediately began to punish those who had supported Timothy; he closed the churches of the Novatianists, who had supported Timothy, and confiscated their property. Hypatia\\'s school seems to have immediately taken a strong distrust towards the new bishop, as evidenced by the fact that, in all his vast correspondences, Synesius only ever wrote one letter to Cyril, in which he treats the younger bishop as inexperienced and misguided. In a letter written to Hypatia in 413, Synesius requests her to intercede on behalf of two individuals impacted by the ongoing civil strife in Alexandria, insisting, \"You always have power, and you can bring about good by using that power.\" He also reminds her that she had taught him that a Neoplatonic philosopher must introduce the highest moral standards to political life and act for the benefit of his or her fellow citizens.\\nIn 414, Cyril closed all the synagogues in Alexandria, confiscated all the property belonging to the Jews, and expelled all the Jews from the city. Orestes, the Roman prefect of Alexandria, who was also a close friend of Hypatia and a recent convert to Christianity, was outraged by Cyril\\'s actions and sent a scathing report to the emperor. The conflict escalated and a riot broke out in which the parabalani, a group of monks under Cyril\\'s authority, nearly killed Orestes. As punishment, Orestes had Ammonius, the monk who had started the riot, publicly tortured to death. Cyril tried to proclaim Ammonius a martyr, but Christians in Alexandria were disgusted, since Ammonius had been killed for inciting a riot and attempting to murder the governor, not for his faith. Prominent Alexandrian Christians intervened and forced Orestes and Cyril to come to an uneasy truce. During the negotiations, Orestes frequently consulted Hypatia for advice because she was well-liked among both pagans and Christians alike, she had not been involved in any previous stages of the conflict, and she had an impeccable reputation as a wise counselor.\\nDespite Hypatia\\'s popularity, Cyril and his allies attempted to discredit her and undermine her reputation. Socrates Scholasticus mentions rumors accusing Hypatia of preventing Orestes from reconciling with Cyril. Traces of other rumors that spread among the Christian populace of Alexandria may be found in the writings of the seventh-century Egyptian Coptic bishop John of Nikiû, who alleges in his Chronicle that Hypatia had engaged in satanic practices and had intentionally hampered the church\\'s influence over Orestes:\\n\\nAnd in those days there appeared in Alexandria a female philosopher, a pagan named Hypatia, and she was devoted at all times to magic, astrolabes and instruments of music, and she beguiled many people through her Satanic wiles. And the governor of the city honoured her exceedingly; for she had beguiled him through her magic. And he ceased attending church as had been his custom... And he not only did this, but he drew many believers to her, and he himself received the unbelievers at his house.\\n\\nAccount from Socrates Scholasticus\\nDuring the Christian season of Lent in March 415, the parabalani under the leadership of a lector named Peter raided Hypatia\\'s carriage as she was travelling home. They dragged her into a nearby church known as the \"Caesareum\", where they stripped her naked and murdered her using ostraka, which can either be translated as \"roof tiles\" or \"oyster shells\". They tore her body into pieces and dragged her mangled limbs through the town to a place called Cinarion, where they set them on fire.\\n\\nInterpretations\\nSocrates Scholasticus presents Hypatia\\'s murder as entirely politically motivated and makes no mention of any role that Hypatia\\'s paganism might have played in her death. Instead, he reasons that \"she fell a victim to the political jealousy which at that time prevailed. For as she had frequent interviews with Orestes, it was calumniously reported among the Christian populace that it was she who prevented Orestes from being reconciled to the bishop.\" Socrates Scholasticus condemns the actions of the mob and declares that \"Surely nothing can be farther from the spirit of Christianity than the allowance of massacres, fights, and transactions of that sort.\"\\nAmong modern historians, Hypatia\\'s death is usually either blamed on Cyril of Alexandria\\'s jealousy, cast as a side event in his power struggle with Orestes, or interpreted as a violent manifestation of the pre-existing turmoil in Alexandria. Modern historians still debate whether and to what extent Cyril may have been involved in the incident. Many historians consider it likely that he at least had some prior knowledge of the murder, but a minority argue that he was totally uninvolved.\\n\\nAftermath\\nHypatia\\'s death sent shockwaves throughout the empire; for centuries, philosophers had been seen as effectively untouchable during the displays of public violence that sometimes occurred in Roman cities and the murder of a female philosopher at the hand of a mob was seen as \"profoundly dangerous and destabilizing\". Although no concrete evidence was ever discovered definitively linking Cyril to the murder of Hypatia, it was widely believed that he had ordered it. Even if Cyril had not directly ordered the murder himself, it was self-evident that his smear campaign against Hypatia had inspired it. The Alexandrian council was alarmed at Cyril\\'s conduct and sent an embassy to Constantinople. Theodosius II\\'s advisors launched an investigation to determine Cyril\\'s role in the murder.\\nThe investigation resulted in the parabalani being removed from Cyril\\'s power and instead placed under the authority of Orestes. Cyril himself allegedly only managed to escape even more serious punishment by bribing one of Theodosius II\\'s officials. Watts argues that Hypatia\\'s murder was the turning point in Cyril\\'s fight to gain political control of Alexandria. Hypatia had been the lynchpin holding Orestes\\'s opposition against Cyril together and, without her, the opposition quickly collapsed. Two years later, Cyril overturned the law placing the parabalani under Orestes\\'s control and, by the early 420s, Cyril had come to dominate the Alexandrian council.\\n\\nWorks\\nWritings\\nHypatia has been described as a universal genius, but she was probably more of a teacher and commentator than an innovator. No evidence has been found that Hypatia ever published any independent works on philosophy and she does not appear to have made any groundbreaking mathematical discoveries. During Hypatia\\'s time period, scholars preserved classical mathematical works and commented on them to develop their arguments, rather than publishing original works. It has also been suggested that the closure of the Mouseion and the destruction of the Serapeum may have led Hypatia and her father to focus their efforts on preserving seminal mathematical books and making them accessible to their students. The Suda mistakenly states that all of Hypatia\\'s writings have been lost, but modern scholarship has identified several works by her as extant. This kind of authorial uncertainty is typical of female philosophers from antiquity. Hypatia wrote in Greek, which was the language spoken by most educated people in the Eastern Mediterranean at the time. In classical antiquity, astronomy was seen as being essentially mathematical in character. Furthermore, no distinction was made between mathematics and numerology or astronomy and astrology.\\n\\nEdition of the Almagest\\nHypatia is now known to have edited the existing text of Book III of Ptolemy\\'s Almagest. It was once thought that Hypatia had merely revised Theon\\'s commentary on the Almagest, based on the title of Theon\\'s commentary on the third book of Almagest, which reads \"Commentary by Theon of Alexandria on Book III of Ptolemy\\'s Almagest, edition revised by my daughter Hypatia, the philosopher\", but, based on analysis of the titles of Theon\\'s other commentaries and similar titles from the time period, scholars have concluded that Hypatia corrected, not her father\\'s commentary, but the text of Almagest itself. Her contribution is thought to be an improved method for the long division algorithms needed for astronomical computation. The Ptolemaic model of the universe was geocentric, meaning it taught that the sun revolved around the earth. In the Almagest, Ptolemy proposed a division problem for calculating the number of degrees swept out by the sun in a single day as it orbits the earth. In his early commentary, Theon had tried to improve upon Ptolemy\\'s division calculation. In the text edited by Hypatia, a tabular method is detailed. This tabular method might be the \"astronomical table\" which historic sources attribute to Hypatia. Classicist Alan Cameron additionally states that it is possible Hypatia may have edited, not only Book III, but all nine extant books of the Almagest.\\n\\nIndependent works\\nHypatia wrote a commentary on Diophantus\\'s thirteen-volume Arithmetica, which had been written sometime around the year 250 AD. It set out more than 100 mathematical problems, for which solutions are proposed using algebra. For centuries, scholars believed that this commentary had been lost. Only volumes one through six of the Arithmetica have survived in the original Greek, but at least four additional volumes have been preserved in an Arabic translation produced around the year 860. The Arabic text contains numerous expansions not found in the Greek text, including verifications of Diophantus\\'s examples and additional problems. Cameron states that the most likely source of the additional material is Hypatia herself, since Hypatia is the only ancient writer known to have written a commentary on the Arithmetica and the additions appear to follow the same methods used by her father Theon. The first person to deduce that the additional material in the Arabic manuscripts came from Hypatia was the nineteenth-century scholar Paul Tannery. In 1885, Sir Thomas Heath published the first English translation of the surviving portion of the Arithmetica. Heath argued that surviving text of Arithmetica is actually a school edition produced by Hypatia to aid her students. According to Mary Ellen Waithe, Hypatia used an unusual algorithm for division (in the then-standard sexagesimal numeral system), making it easy for scholars to pick out which parts of the text she had written.\\nThe consensus that Hypatia\\'s commentary is the source of the additional material in the Arabic manuscripts of the Arithmetica has been challenged by Wilbur Knorr, a historian of mathematics, who argues that the interpolations are \"of such low level as not to require any real mathematical insight\" and that the author of the interpolations can only have been \"an essentially trivial mind... in direct conflict with ancient testimonies of Hypatia\\'s high caliber as a philosopher and mathematician.\" Cameron rejects this argument, noting that \"Theon too enjoyed a high reputation, yet his surviving work has been judged \\'completely unoriginal.\\'\" Cameron also insists that \"Hypatia\\'s work on Diophantus was what we today might call a school edition, designed for the use of students rather than professional mathematicians.\" Hypatia also wrote a commentary on Apollonius of Perga\\'s work on conic sections, but this commentary is no longer extant. She also created an \"Astronomical Canon\"; this is believed to have been either a new edition of the Handy Tables by the Alexandrian Ptolemy or the aforementioned commentary on his Almagest. A high degree of mathematical accomplishment would have been needed to comment on Apollonius\\'s advanced mathematics or the astronomical Canon. Because of this, most scholars today recognize that Hypatia must have been among the leading mathematicians of her day.\\n\\nInventions and observations\\nOne of Synesius\\'s letters describes Hypatia as having taught him how to construct a silver plane astrolabe as a gift for an official. An astrolabe is a device used to calculate date and time based on the positions of the stars and planets. It can also be used to predict where the stars and planets will be on any given date. A \"little astrolabe\", or \"plane astrolabe\", is a kind of astrolabe that used stereographic projection of the celestial sphere to represent the heavens on a plane surface, as opposed to an armillary sphere, which was globe-shaped.\\nThe statement from Synesius\\'s letter has sometimes been wrongly interpreted to mean that Hypatia invented the plane astrolabe herself, but the plane astrolabe is known to have been in use at least 500 years before Hypatia was born. Hypatia probably learned how to construct a plane astrolabe from her father Theon, who had written a treatise on it. Theon\\'s treatise is now lost, but its translations are credited with having transmitted the theoretical concept of plane astrolabes to the Arabic world and parts of it may be preserved in the writings of Severus Sebokht. Synesius\\'s writings reflect the Neoplatonist belief that knowledge of the divine is attainable through observing the heavens.\\nIn another letter, Synesius requests Hypatia to construct him a \"hydroscope\", a device now known as a hydrometer, to determine the density or specific gravity of liquids. Based on this request, it has been claimed that Hypatia invented the hydrometer herself, but the minute detail in which Synesius describes the instrument indicates that he assumes she has never heard of the device, but trusts she will be able to replicate it based on a verbal description. Although modern authors frequently credit Hypatia with having developed a variety of other inventions, these other attributions may all be discounted as spurious.\\nAri Belenkiy describes Hypatia\\'s astronomical work as pivotal for the politics of the region, focusing on controversies related to observations of the equinox and the timing of festivals, ultimately serving to highlight errors in Ptolemy\\'s work and the need for independent observation. In two consecutive works (2010, 2016) Belenkiy proposed an astronomical-calendrical paradigm for Hypatia\\'s murder. Comparing two principal sources on Hypatia, of Socrates Scholasticus and Philostorgius, Belenkiy suggests that Hypatia carried out equinoctial observations in 414-415, initiated on the request of governor Orestes. This could have been the litmus test of who was right in the conflicts over the 414 Easter day waged by Cyril, the Bishop of the Alexandrian Church, with the local Jewish and Novatian communities. Hypatia\\'s success in establishing the correct day of the vernal equinox could undermine the Alexandrian Church\\'s authority in the timing of Easter, as it used equinoctial computations based on Ptolemy\\'s Syntaxis (Almagest).\\n\\nLegacy\\nAntiquity\\nHypatia had no appointed successor, no spouse, and no offspring and her sudden death not only left her legacy unprotected, but also triggered a backlash against her entire ideology. Hypatia, with her tolerance towards Christian students and her willingness to cooperate with Christian leaders, had hoped to establish a precedent that Neoplatonism and Christianity could coexist peacefully and cooperatively. Instead, her death and the subsequent failure by the Christian government to impose justice on her killers destroyed that notion entirely and led future Neoplatonists such as Damascius to consider Christian bishops as \"dangerous, jealous figures who were also utterly unphilosophical.\" Hypatia became seen as a \"martyr for philosophy\" and her murder led philosophers to adopt attitudes that increasingly emphasized the pagan aspects of their beliefs system and helped create a sense of identity for philosophers as pagan traditionalists set apart from the Christian masses.\\nShortly after Hypatia\\'s murder, a forged anti-Christian letter appeared under her name. Damascius was \"anxious to exploit the scandal of Hypatia\\'s death\", and attributed responsibility for her murder to Bishop Cyril and his Christian followers. A passage from Damascius\\'s Life of Isidore, preserved in the Suda, concludes that Hypatia\\'s murder was due to Cyril\\'s envy over \"her wisdom exceeding all bounds and especially in the things concerning astronomy\". Damascius\\'s account of the Christian murder of Hypatia is the sole historical source attributing direct responsibility to Bishop Cyril. At the same time, Damascius was not entirely kind to Hypatia either; he characterizes her as nothing more than a wandering Cynic, and compares her unfavorably with his own teacher Isidore of Alexandria, remarking that \"Isidorus greatly outshone Hypatia, not just as a man does over a woman, but in the way a genuine philosopher will over a mere geometer.\"\\n\\nMiddle Ages\\nHypatia\\'s death was similar to those of Christian martyrs in Alexandria, who had been dragged through the streets during the Decian persecution in 250. Other aspects of Hypatia\\'s life also fit the mold for a Christian martyr, especially her lifelong virginity. In the Early Middle Ages, Christians conflated Hypatia\\'s death with stories of the Decian martyrs and she became part of the basis for the legend of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, a virgin martyr said to have been exceedingly wise and well-educated. The earliest attestation for the cult of Saint Catherine comes from the eighth century, around three hundred years after Hypatia\\'s death. One story tells of Saint Catherine being confronted by fifty pagan philosophers seeking to convert her, but instead converting all of them to Christianity through her eloquence. Another legend claimed that Saint Catherine had been a student of Athanasius of Alexandria.\\nThe Suda describes legends of Hypatia being married, claiming that she was \"the wife of Isidore the Philosopher\" (apparently Isidore of Alexandria); however, Isidore of Alexandria was not born until long after Hypatia\\'s death, and no other philosopher of that name contemporary with Hypatia is known. The intellectual Eudokia Makrembolitissa (1021–1096), the second wife of Byzantine emperor Constantine X Doukas, was described by the historian Nicephorus Gregoras as a \"second Hypatia\".\\n\\nEarly modern period\\nThe early eighteenth-century Deist scholar John Toland used the murder of Hypatia as the basis for the anti-Catholic tract, Hypatia: Or the History of a most beautiful, most vertuous, most learned, and every way accomplish\\'d Lady; who was torn to pieces by the Clergy of Alexandria, to gratify the pride, emulation, and cruelty of their Archbishop, commonly, but undeservedly, stil\\'d St. Cyril. In order to portray Hypatia\\'s death in the worst possible light, Toland changed the story and invented elements not found in any of the ancient sources. In 1721, Thomas Lewis wrote a response defending Cyril entitled The History of Hypatia, a most Impudent School-Mistress of Alexandria: Murder\\'d and torn to Pieces by the Populace, in Defence of Saint Cyril and the Alexandrian Clergy from the Aspersions of Mr. Toland. Lewis rejected Damascius\\'s account as unreliable out of hand on account of the fact that its author was \"a heathen\" and then proceeded to argue that Socrates Scholasticus was \"a Puritan\", who was consistently biased against Cyril.\\nVoltaire, in his Examen important de Milord Bolingbroke ou le tombeau de fantisme (1736) interpreted Hypatia as a believer in \"the laws of rational Nature\" and \"the capacities of the human mind free of dogmas\" and described her death as \"a bestial murder perpetrated by Cyril\\'s tonsured hounds, with a fanatical gang at their heels\". Later, in an entry for his Dictionnaire philosophique (1772), Voltaire again portrayed Hypatia as a freethinking deistic genius brutally murdered by ignorant and misunderstanding Christians. Most of the entry ignores Hypatia herself altogether and instead deals with the controversy over whether or not Cyril was responsible for her death. Voltaire concludes with the snide remark that \"When one strips beautiful women naked, it is not to massacre them.\"\\nIn his monumental work The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, the English historian Edward Gibbon expanded on Toland and Voltaire\\'s misleading portrayals by declaring Cyril as the sole cause of all evil in Alexandria at the beginning of the fifth century and construing Hypatia\\'s murder as evidence to support his polemical thesis that the rise of Christianity was the sole cause of the Roman Empire\\'s decline. He remarks on Cyril\\'s continued veneration as a Christian saint, commenting that \"superstition [Christianity] perhaps would more gently expiate the blood of a virgin, than the banishment of a saint.\" In response to these accusations, Catholic authors, as well as some French Protestants, insisted with increased vehemence that Cyril had absolutely no involvement in Hypatia\\'s murder and that Peter the Lector was solely responsible. In the course of these heated debates, Hypatia herself tended to be cast aside and ignored, while the debates focused far more intently on the question of whether Peter the Lector had acted alone or under Cyril\\'s orders.\\n\\nNineteenth century\\nIn nineteenth century European literary authors spun the legend of Hypatia as part of neo-Hellenism, a movement that romanticised ancient Greeks and their values. Interest in the \"literary legend of Hypatia\" began to rise. Diodata Saluzzo Roero\\'s 1827 Ipazia ovvero delle Filosofie suggested that Cyril had actually converted Hypatia to Christianity, and that she had been killed by a \"treacherous\" priest.\\nIn his 1852 Hypatie and 1857 Hypathie et Cyrille, French poet Charles Leconte de Lisle portrayed Hypatia as the epitome of \"vulnerable truth and beauty\". Leconte de Lisle\\'s first poem portrayed Hypatia as a woman born after her time, a victim of the laws of history. His second poem reverted back to the eighteenth-century Deistic portrayal of Hypatia as the victim of Christian brutality, but with the twist that Hypatia tries and fails to convince Cyril that Neoplatonism and Christianity are actually fundamentally the same. Charles Kingsley\\'s 1853 novel Hypatia; Or, New Foes with an Old Face was originally intended as a historical treatise, but instead became a typical mid-Victorian romance with a militantly anti-Catholic message, portraying Hypatia as a \"helpless, pretentious, and erotic heroine\" with the \"spirit of Plato and the body of Aphrodite.\"\\nKingsley\\'s novel was tremendously popular; it was translated into several European languages and remained continuously in print for the rest of the century. It promoted the romantic vision of Hypatia as \"the last of the Hellenes\" and was quickly adapted into a broad variety of stage productions, the first of which was a play written by Elizabeth Bowers, performed in Philadelphia in 1859, starring the writer herself in the titular role. On 2 January 1893, a much higher-profile stage play adaptation Hypatia, written by G. Stuart Ogilvie and produced by Herbert Beerbohm Tree, opened at the Haymarket Theatre in London. The title role was initially played by Julia Neilson, and it featured an elaborate musical score written by the composer Hubert Parry. The novel also spawned works of visual art, including an 1867 portrait of Hypatia as a young woman by the early photographer Julia Margaret Cameron and an 1885 painting by Charles William Mitchell showing a nude Hypatia standing before an altar in a church.\\nAt the same time, European philosophers and scientists described Hypatia as the last representative of science and free inquiry before a \"long medieval decline\". In 1843, German authors Soldan and Heppe argued in their highly influential History of the Witchcraft Trials that Hypatia may have been, in effect, the first famous \"witch\" punished under Christian authority (see witch-hunt).\\nHypatia was honored as a astronomer when 238 Hypatia, a main belt asteroid discovered in 1884, was named for her. The Lunar crater Hypatia was also named for her, in addition to craters named for her father Theon. The 180 km Rimae Hypatia are located north of the crater, one degree south of the equator, along the Mare Tranquillitatis.\\n\\nTwentieth century\\nIn 1908, the American writer Elbert Hubbard published a putative biography of Hypatia as part of his series Little Journeys to the Homes of Great Teachers. Despite its claimed biographical intentions, the book is almost entirely a work of fiction. In it, Hubbard relates in great detail a completely made-up physical exercise program which he claims Theon established for his daughter, involving \"fishing, horseback-riding, and rowing\". He also claims that Theon taught Hypatia to \"Reserve your right to think, for even to think wrongly is better than to never think at all.\" Hubbard even relates how, as a young woman, Hypatia traveled to Athens, where she was a student of the revered philosopher Plutarch of Athens. All of this supposed biographical information, however, is completely fictional and is not found in any ancient source. Hubbard even attributes to Hypatia numerous completely fabricated quotations in which she is presented as espousing modern, rationalist views. The cover illustration for the book, a drawing of Hypatia by artist Jules Maurice Gaspard showing her as a beautiful young women with her wavy hair tied back in the classical style, has now became the most iconic and widely reproduced image of her.\\nAround the same time, Hypatia was adopted by feminists and her life and death began to be viewed in the light of the women\\'s rights movement. The author Carlo Pascal claimed in 1908 that her murder was an anti-feminist act and brought about a change in the treatment of women, as well as the decline of the Mediterranean civilization in general. Dora Russell, the wife of Bertrand Russell, published a book on the inadequate education of women and inequality with the title Hypatia or Woman and Knowledge in 1925. The prologue explains why she chose the title: \"Hypatia was a university lecturer denounced by Church dignitaries and torn to pieces by Christians. Such will probably be the fate of this book.\" Hypatia\\'s death became symbolic for some historians. For example, Kathleen Wider proposes that the murder of Hypatia marked the end of Classical antiquity, and Stephen Greenblatt observes that her murder \"effectively marked the downfall of Alexandrian intellectual life\". On the other hand, Christian Wildberg notes that Hellenistic philosophy continued to flourish in the 5th and 6th centuries, and perhaps until the age of Justinian I.\\nWidespread falsehoods and misconceptions about Hypatia continued to proliferate throughout the late twentieth century. Even though Hubbard\\'s fictional biography in Little Journeys to the Homes of Great Teachers was probably only intended for children, the scholar Lynn M. Osen relied on it as her main source in her influential 1974 biographical article about Hypatia in her book Women in Mathematics, published by the MIT Press in 1974. Likewise, Fordham University used Hubbard\\'s biography as the main source of information about Hypatia in their medieval history course. The thirteenth and final episode of Carl Sagan\\'s 1980 PBS series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage relates a heavily fictionalized retelling of Hypatia\\'s death, which results in the \"Great Library of Alexandria\" being burned by militant Christians. In actuality, though Christians led by Theophilus did indeed destroy the Serapeum in 391 AD, the Library of Alexandria had already ceased to exist in any recognizable form centuries prior to Hypatia\\'s birth. As a female intellectual, Hypatia became a role model for modern intelligent women and two feminist journals were named after her: the Greek journal Hypatia: Feminist Studies was launched in Athens in 1984, and Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy was launched in the United States in 1986. In the United Kingdom, the Hypatia Trust has compiled a library and archive of feminine literary, artistic and scientific work since 1996. An extension of the trust has established the Hypatia-in-the-Woods retreat in Washington State, where artistic, business and academic women can spend time to work on projects.\\nJudy Chicago\\'s large-scale art piece The Dinner Party awards Hypatia a table setting. Hypatia\\'s place setting is decorated with Coptic designs and the head of a Hellenistic goddess forms the \"H\" in her name. Along the runner of the table, more Hellenistic goddesses are shown weeping in horror over Hypatia\\'s death. Chicago, in her description of Hypatia\\'s spot at the table, states that the social unrest leading to Hypatia\\'s murder was the direct result of Roman patriarchy and the mistreatment of women and that the unrest, which is still ongoing, can only be brought to an end through the restoration of the original, primeval matriarchy. She further blames Cyril for having instigated the murder and concludes that all of Hypatia\\'s writings were burned in the Library of Alexandria when it was deliberately destroyed, apparently under the assumption that this was done many years later. Major works of twentieth century literature contain references to Hypatia, including Marcel Proust\\'s stories \"Madame Swann At Home\" and \"Within a Budding Grove\" from In Search of Lost Time, and Iain Pears\\'s The Dream of Scipio.\\n\\nTwenty-first century\\nHypatia\\'s life continues to be fictionalized by authors in many countries and languages. In Umberto Eco\\'s 2002 novel Baudolino, the hero falls in love with a half-satyr, half-woman, who is descended from a group of Hypatia\\'s young female disciples, who fled after their teacher\\'s murder. These disciples set up a female-only community who \"tried to keep alive what they had learned from their mistress... [living] apart from the world, to rediscover what Hypatia had really said.\" All the women, who reproduce by \"fecundation\" with satyrs, are named Hypatia and are collectively known as \"hypatias\". Charlotte Kramer\\'s 2006 novel Holy Murder: the Death of Hypatia of Alexandria portrays Cyril as an archetypal villain without an ounce of good. Hypatia is repeatedly described as brilliant and beloved and she humiliates Cyril by demonstrating that she knows more about the Christian scriptures than he does. Ki Longfellow\\'s novel Flow Down Like Silver (2009) invents an elaborate backstory for why Hypatia first started teaching. Youssef Ziedan\\'s novel Azazeel (2012) describes Hypatia\\'s brutal murder through the eyes of the monk Hypa, who witnesses the incident. In The Plot to Save Socrates (2006) by Paul Levinson and its sequels Unburning Alexandria (novelette, 2008; novel 2013) and Chronica, Hypatia turns out to have been a time-traveler from the twenty-first century United States.\\nThe 2009 movie Agora, directed by Alejandro Amenábar and starring Rachel Weisz as Hypatia, is a heavily fictionalized dramatization of Hypatia\\'s final years. The film, which was intended to criticize contemporary Christian fundamentalism, has had wide-ranging impact on the popular conception of Hypatia. Unlike previous fictional adaptations, Agora emphasizes Hypatia\\'s astronomical and mechanical studies rather than her philosophy, portraying her as \"less Plato than Copernicus\". It also, more than any other previous portrayal, emphasizes the restrictions imposed on women by the early Christian church. In one scene, Hypatia is sexually assaulted by one of her father\\'s slaves, who has recently converted to Christianity, and, in another scene, Cyril reads a verse from 1 Timothy 2:8-12 forbidding women from teaching. Near the end of the film, Synesius warns Orestes that he must abandon his friendship with Hypatia in order to retain his faith as a Christian. The film also portrays Cyril and his monks as swarthy, bearded men with covered heads clad in tattered black clothing, resembling media portrayals of the Taliban.\\nThe film, however, also contains numerous historical inaccuracies: It inflates Hypatia\\'s achievements and incorrectly portrays her as having discovered proof to support Aristarchus of Samos\\'s heliocentric model of the universe, for which there is no evidence that Hypatia ever even studied. It also contains a scene based on the final episode from Carl Sagan\\'s Cosmos in which a mob of Christians raid the Serapeum and burn all of the scrolls in it, but leave the building itself largely intact, aside from knocking over a few statues. In historical reality, the Serapeum probably did not have any scrolls in it at the time of its destruction and the Christians completely demolished the building to the ground. The film also strongly implies that Hypatia is an atheist, a notion directly contradictory to the surviving sources, which all portray her as a devoted follower of the teachings of Plotinus, who taught that the goal of philosophy was \"a mystical union with the divine.\"\\n\\nNotes\\nReferences\\nBibliography\\nFurther reading\\nExternal links\\nInternational Society for Neoplatonic Studies\\nSocrates of Constantinople, Ecclesiastical History, VII.15, at the Internet Archive\\n(in Greek) (in Latin) Socrates of Constantinople, Ecclesiastical History, VII.15 (pp. 760–761), at the Documenta Catholica Omnia'), (1114, 'Mary Lou Jepsen (born 1965) is a technical executive and inventor in the fields of display, imaging, and computer hardware.\\nHer most recent endeavor is OpenWater, a startup aiming to make fMRI-type imaging inside the body practical at the price level of consumer electronics and in wearable form factors.

In 1869, believing that the spirits wanted her there, she moved to Chicago, where she wrote for a number of periodicals, including Western Rural, Universe, Interior, and Bright Sides.\\n\\nPatents and inventions – 1872–1880\\nIn 1872, Jones developed a vacuum canning process for preserving food, with the help of Professor Leroy C. Cooley of Albany, who was the brother-in-law of her sister Emily. The following year she obtained five patents relating to her process, of which two listed her as sole inventor. Again following the advice of the spirits she communicated with, she developed another invention, an oil burner, which she patented in 1880. However, her attempts to establish businesses based on her inventions were unsuccessful, and she returned to writing, publishing A Prairie Idyll in 1882. There is one reference (Stanley, Autumn – See Bibliography) that maintains she has a patent for a Ready-Opener Tin Can, but that is the only, unsupported, reference to this patent.\\n\\nFounding of Women\\'s Canning and Preserving Company – 1890\\nA strong supporter of women\\'s rights and suffrage, she founded the Women\\'s Canning and Preserving Company in Chicago in 1890, which employed only women. In an address to her employees, Jones said that \"This is a woman\\'s industry. No man will vote our stock, transact our business, keep our books, pronounce on women\\'s wages, supervise our factories. Give men whatever work is suitable, but keep the governing power. This is a business training school for working women – you with all the rest. Here is a mission; let it be fulfilled.\" When this venture failed in 1893, she left Chicago for Junction City, Kansas, where two of her sisters lived.\\n\\nLater life\\nJones continued to work with both of her inventions, obtaining patents on the canning process in 1903, 1905, and 1906, and additional patents relating to the oil burner in 1904, 1912, and 1914. She continued to publish occasional literary works, including the Rubaiyat of Solomon and Other Poems in 1905.\\nFollowing the Spanish–American War the U.S. Navy began investigating the transition from coal fired ships to oil. In 1904 they released a 489-page report which detailed extensively a comparison between coal and oil. Jones was asked to write a technical review of the report for Engineer: With which is Incorporated Steam Engineering. According to her obituary she was paid liberally for her contribution of four articles in 1904 and 1905. Those articles are online at the HathiTrust:\\nTHE LIQUID FUEL PROBLEM Part I (Vol 41 – 1904 – pages 821–822) (A Review of the Completed \"Report of the U.S. Navy Liquid Fuel Board,issued Sept., 1904).\\nTHE LIQUID FUEL PROBLEM – II (Vol 41 – 1904 – pages 855–856)\\nTHE LIQUID FUEL PROBLEM – III (Vol 42 – 1905 – page 90)\\nTHE LIQUID FUEL PROBLEM – IV (Vol.42 – 1905 pages 108–109)\\nIn 1910, she published her autobiography, A Psychic Autobiography, which focused on her interest in spiritualism. Late in her life, she moved to Brooklyn, New York, to pursue business interests, where she died of influenza in 1914. She was listed in Who\\'s Who in America for 1912–13 and in Woman\\'s Who\\'s Who in America for 1914–15.\\nShe is buried in Riverside Cemetery, Cleveland, Ohio in her brother William\\'s plot.\\n\\nNotes\\nReferences\\nFurther reading\\nThe following books have articles about Jones:\\nVare, Ethlie Ann, Greg Ptacek, and Ethlie Ann Vare. 1988.

Her factory in Moline, Illinois, mainly employed women over the age of 40. She is best known for inventing an airplane muffler, but also developed a lightweight electric iron, a travel-size ironing board, a collapsible hat-rack, and an \"anti-damp salt shaker\".\\nJones was born in 1860 in Palmyra, Missouri. Her family moved to St. Louis, and her father, Alonzo Jones, deserted them. Eldorado first took work as a teacher in Lafayette, Indiana; detesting this job, she became a stenographer at an insurance company in Chicago.\\nBy 1913, however, she had become an inventor, and opened an all-women factory in Moline, Illinois, dedicated to manufacturing her creations. She devised an airplane muffler in 1919. Following tests at Roosevelt Field, she patented the invention in 1923. Time magazine described the muffler in action:\\n\\nPuffing upon one cigaret after another, Miss Jones directed mechanics in attaching to the Cirrus engine of a Moth biplane a muffler of her own invention. As the plane sped along the runway and over the hangars there were noises—of thrumming propeller, snapping pistons, vibrating metal—but there was no bark of exhaust.\\n\\nAs Popular Science reported in 1931, the muffler reduced noise without reducing power. That same year, Modern Mechanics and Inventions described it as \"the first successful exhaust muffler for airplane engines.\" The muffler used \"a series of small pinwheels which \\'chew up\\' the sound waves and retard the passage of exhaust gases without creating undue back pressure upon the engine.\"\\nThe New York Times noted Jones\\'s \"energy, her self-reliance, and her general distrust of men.\" According to the historian Anne MacDonald, Jones\\'s dim view of the opposite gender made it harder for her to capitalize on the muffler.\\nShe did not meet with the success she sought, and her death in 1932 was observed in the New York Times with the headline, Woman Inventor Dies in Poverty. The obituary closed with a quotation from Jones: \"Do not forget to exploit men all you can. Because if you don\\'t, they will exploit you.\"\\n\\nExternal links\\nClipping from Eugene Register\\n\"Finding Eldorado (my search for The Iron Woman)\\nSharon Hall, \"Mothers of Invention: Eldorado Jones (Airplane Muffler)\", Digging History, 2014\\n\\n\\n== References =='), (1118, 'Marjorie Stewart Joyner (October 24, 1896 – December 27, 1994) was an American businesswoman. She was born in 1896, in Monterey, Virginia. she was the granddaughter of a slave and a white slave-owner.She moved to Chicago in 1912, and shortly thereafter, she began studying cosmetology. She graduated A.B. Molar Beauty School in Chicago in 1916, the first African American to achieve this.That year, at the age of 20, she married podiatrist Robert E. Joyner and opened her salon.That was where she met Madam C. J. Walker, an African American beauty entrepreneur, and the owner of a cosmetic empire. Always a lover of women\\'s cosmetics, Joyner went to work for her and oversaw 200 of Madame Walker\\'s beauty schools as the national adviser. A major role was sending Walker\\'s hair stylists door-to-door, dressed in black skirts and white blouses with black satchels containing a range of beauty products that were applied in the customer\\'s house. Joyner taught some 15,000 stylists over her fifty-year career. She was also a leader in developing new products, such as her permanent wave machine. She helped write the first cosmetology laws for the state of Illinois, and founded a sorority and fraternity, Alpha Chi Pi Omega on October 27, 1945 as well as a national association for black beauticians. Joyner was friends with Eleanor Roosevelt, and helped found the National Council of Negro Women. She was an advisor to the Democratic National Committee in the 1940s, and advised several New Deal agencies trying to reach out to black women. Joyner was highly visible in the Chicago black community, as head of the Chicago Defender Charity network, and fundraiser for various schools. In 1987 the Smithsonian Institution in Washington opened an exhibit featuring Joyner\\'s permanent wave machine and a replica of her original salon. Marjorie Stewart Joyner died of heart failure at her South Side Chicago home on December 27, 1994, at the age of ninety-eight.\\n\\nPermanent Wave Design\\nIn 1939, she started looking for an easier way for women to curl their hair, taking her inspiration from a pot roast cooking with paper pins to quicken preparation time. Joyner experimented initially with these paper rods and soon designed a table that could be used to curl or straighten hair by wrapping it on rods above the person\\'s head and then cooking them to set the hair. This method allowed hairstyles to last several days. At the beginning of her invention there was complaints from users that it was uncomfortable. That was when Marjorie improved it with the simple idea of having a scalp protector while the lady is curling her hair. Her patent for this design, (U.S. pat. #1,693,515) established her as the first African American woman to receive a patent. This claim is disputed by some who say that Sarah E. Goode was the first African American woman to hold a patent.\\nIt is sometimes falsely cited that Joyner was the original inventor of this type of machine, called the permanent wave, or perm. Her design was an alternative version of Karl Nessler\\'s groundbreaking invention, invented in England during the late 19th century and patented in London in 1909 and again in the United States in 1925.(U.S. Patent 1,522,258)\\nJoyner\\'s design was popular in salons with both African American and white women. The patent was credited to Madame Walker\\'s company and she received almost no money for it. In 1967, she co-founded the United Beauty School Owners and Teachers Association. In 1973, at the age of 77, she was awarded a bachelor\\'s degree in psychology from Bethune-Cookman College in Daytona Beach, Florida.\\nShe also got techniques from Madame Walker.\\nCurrently, her papers reside in the Vivian G.

She was the first registered female architect in Pennsylvania and she was \"the first woman to actually practice architecture professionally\".\\n\\nEarly life\\nKeichline was the youngest of four children, born in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania to attorney John Keichline. Her parents gave her a workshop and carpentry tools, which she used to create furniture. She won a prize for a table and chest she made at a county fair in 1903, when she was 14, and her work was praised as comparing \"favorably with the work of a skilled mechanic\". She told a newspaper reporter that she expected to devote her life to industrial design. She graduated from Bellefonte High School in 1906. She studied mechanical engineering for a year at Pennsylvania State College, the only woman in her class, and moved to Cornell University, graduating in 1911, their fifth female to receive an architecture degree. She played basketball at Cornell, served as class officer, and was a sorority and drama club member. Keichline was definitely aware of the disadvantage and difficulty being a woman in architecture – a male-dominated field – but she was not discouraged. She was convinced that women could be just as successful because of their innate understanding of space in a home.\\n\\nInventions\\nShe became noted for working on \"time- and motion-saving\" design of kitchens and interiors. She owned seven patents. She had several inventions concerning home use, but her most noted invention was the \"K Brick\" in 1927. This type of hollow clay brick was less heavy and expensive than previous iterations and was an early form of the concrete block used in construction decades later. This led to her receiving honors from the American Ceramic Society in 1931.\\nHer first patent combined a sink and a washtub. She wanted to save space in kitchens and make them more comfortable to use. In 1924 she received a patent on one of her kitchen designs. The design was focused on \"comfort and convenience, efficiency, and conservation of space.\" This kitchen featured sloped countertops and cabinets with glass doors. In 1929 she received a patent on an apartment bed design. It could be flipped into the wall to save space.\\nHer most famous invention was the K Brick, which lead to the development of the concrete block. It was patented in 1927 and she was honored for it by the American Ceramic Society in 1931. The K Brick was made of clay and used for hollow wall construction. It can be described as an inexpensive, light, fireproof clay brick that could be filled with insulating or sound-proofing material. Keichline noted that her K Brick, “requires less to make than brick and because of its design takes less time to fire – the tile would reduce the weight of the wall by one-half.”\\n\\nPatents\\nSink for Apartments (1912)\\nToy (1916)\\nComponents for Kitchen Construction (1926)\\nK Brick (1927)\\nChild’s Portable Partition (1927)\\nFolding Bed for Apartments (1929)\\nAir System (1931)\\n\\nArchitecture\\nThroughout her professional career, she designed seven patents that had great impact on day-to-day life. She also designed houses in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Washington, D.C. Although the homes she designed have been torn down or renovated, she has left a lasting legacy. She was honored in 2002 with in an official state of Pennsylvania historical marker placed in front of the Plaza Theater, which she designed in 1925. Also, her great niece, Nancy Perkins carried on her legacy by establishing her own industrial design firm, Perkins Design Ltd. Keichline\\'s designs can still be seen in Bellefonte. She designed the Plaza Theatre, the Cadillac Garage and Apartments, the Harvey Apartments, as well as multiple residences.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nKeichline had her own automobile, which was unusual for women at the time. She was also involved in World War I efforts, serving as a \"special agent with military intelligence.\" She got involved with politics, helping with President Hoover\\'s Better Housing Conference and leading a march in Bellefonte of Suffragists during nationally organized protests on July 4, 1913.\\n\\nWorld War I Involvements\\nDuring World War I, Keichline served as a Special Agent in the Military Intelligence Division in Washington D.C. When talking about her qualifications for this duty she described herself as,\\n\\n...twenty-eight and physically somewhat stronger than the average. Might add that I can operate and take care of a car [she owned her own automobile]. The above might suggest a drafting or office job, but if you should deem it advisable to give me something more difficult or as I wish to say more dangerous, I should much prefer it. You have asked for my salary in order to rate me. ...last year my fees amounted to something over six thousand.\\n\\nToday her fees amounted to over $92,000 and she received letters from her superiors for the quality of her service.\\n\\n\\n== References =='), (1120, \"Mary Beatrice Davidson Kenner (May 17, 1912 – January 13, 2006) was an African-American inventor most noted for her development of the sanitary belt.

She is notable for creating the miniature pH electrode, her work on artificial respiration, and her pioneering work shaping the discipline of audiometry.\\n\\nEarly life and education\\nPhyllis Margaret Tookey was born in 1901, the only daughter of William Alfred Tookey of Bromley, Kent. She studied at the City of London School for Girls, where she performed well in science. She then studied chemistry and physics at UCL, obtaining her honours degree in 1922. She completed her PhD, with a thesis on the Use of the Glass Electrode in Biochemistry, in 1927. In 1926, she appears to have married William Kerridge and moved from her family home to St Petersburgh Place. Whilst acting as a lecturer in the UCL department of physiology, she also studied medicine at University College Hospital, qualifying in 1933 and obtaining MRCP in 1937. She was a committee member of the Women\\'s Union Society in her student days.\\n\\nScientific career\\nKerridge worked at UCL; the Marine Biological Association, Plymouth; the Physiological Laboratory, Cambridge; the Carlsberg Chemical Laboratorium, Copenhagen; the Medical Unit of the London Hospital; the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and University College Hospital, London (from which she was seconded by the Emergency Medical Service to St. Margaret\\'s Hospital during the war).\\n\\nInvention of the miniature pH electrode\\nIn 1925, supported by DSIR and MRC funding, Kerridge published a paper on her invention of a glass electrode for analysing biochemical samples such as blood. For her biochemical PhD research, Kerridge had required a tool small enough to fit into narrow layers in living tissue, but the design of existing pH electrodes was unsuitable because they provided only very small signals. Kerridge overcame this problem by inventing the miniature pH electrode, with a heat-treated platinum component that gave a much larger signal than the older equipment, enabling accurate measurement even in low fluid volumes. Kerridge noted challenges in developing this equipment, including the high resistance of glass, danger of breakage to the delicate apparatus, and risk of short-circuit.\\n\\nArtificial respiration\\nAfter qualifying in medicine in the early 1930s, Kerridge was recommended by Dr Edward Poulton to scientific instrument maker Robert W. Paul, who sought someone to conduct rigorous physiological tests on a respirator called the \"pulsator\" created by William Henry Bragg. Kerridge\\'s tests provided extensive physiological measurements that improved the efficiency of the device, and she also suggested improvements to the design that reduced its complexity and bulk. Mr S. Crosby Halahan, Bragg\\'s neighbour and the inspiration for his respirator, was kept alive via artificial respiration for two years after becoming completely paralysed – Kerridge adapted the design to make it more comfortable for him.\\nIn addition to doing much to improve the design of the respirator, Kerridge also played an active role in publicising it. She had photographs taken of her laboratory assistant wearing the device, advised Bragg and Paul to publish their introduction in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine, and wrote about the features of the case for The Lancet in order that it would reach the attention of General practitioners.\\n\\nWork on deafness and hearing aids\\nLater in the 1930s, Kerridge worked at the Royal Ear Hospital and developed audiometric standards for hearing tests. Kerridge also played a significant role in establishing hearing aid clinics for the deaf. Her keen interest in music inspired her sympathy for those with hearing loss. This work particularly focussed on the incidence of deafness in children, and she encouraged her students to accompany her on visits to slums to explore potential factors in the etiology of deafness in school-children. In 1936, the Medical Research Council funded her to test the hearing of schoolchildren across London. Her data was garnered from experiments in the ‘silence room’, a soundproof room of some 3,500 cubic feet in the basement of University College Hospital on Huntley Street in London. This was the first site in Great Britain to have a permanent Western Electric Audiometer that used pure-tone testing rather than speech recording.\\n\\nCollaborations with the British Post Office\\nKerridge\\'s expertise in hearing aid technology was used by the British Post Office in its attempts to improve sound quality over telephone lines. The Post Office engineers were initially concerned with Kerridge’s discussion of bone conduction and quoted her extensively in their exploration of improvements to amplified telephony reports. However, she collaborated with the Post Office more extensively when she tested the hearing of telephonists using her audiometer, and in 1937 she installed Post Office amplified telephones designed for people with hearing loss into her clinic. The results of her clinical tests provided data that the Post Office used to improve its amplified telephone service, and the phonetic tests that Kerridge had created with Dennis Butler Fry were later used in the Post Office\\'s design of the Medresco- the first NHS hearing aid.\\n\\nSecond World War\\nAt the outbreak of the war, Kerridge was working at University College Hospital. She was seconded from there to serve the Emergency Medical Service at St Margaret\\'s Hospital, Epping. There, Kerridge and her colleagues created an improvised laboratory for work in pathology and blood transfusions.\\nIn 1940, Kerridge died aged 38.\\n\\n\\n== References =='), (1122, \"Mary Dixon Kies (March 21, 1752 – 1837) was an American inventor. On May 5, 1809, her patent for a new technique of weaving straw with silk and thread to make hats was signed by President James Madison. Some sources state that she was the first American woman to receive a patent, however others state that Hannah Slater was the first.\\n\\nBiography\\nFamily life\\nMary's father, John Dixon, was a farmer born in 1679 in Ulster, Ireland. Her mother, Janet Kennedy, was John Dixon's third wife. They had married in Voluntown, Connecticut on August 7, 1741. Mary Dixon was born in Killingly, Connecticut on March 21, 1752. She married Isaac Pike I, and in 1770 they had a son, Isaac Pike II. After his death she married John Kies (1750–1813) who died on August 18, 1813 at age 63. She then lived with her second son, Daniel Kies, in Brooklyn, New York, until her death at age 85 in 1837.\\n\\nCareer\\nBecause of the Napoleonic Wars, the United States embargoed all trade with France and Great Britain, creating a need for American-made hats to replace European millinery. The straw-weaving industry filled the gap, with over $500,000 ($9 million in today's money) worth of straw bonnets produced in Massachusetts alone in 1810.\\nMary Kies was not the first American woman to innovate in hat-making. In 1798, New Englander Betsy Metcalf invented a method of braiding straw. Her method became very popular, and she employed many women and girls to make her hats. The method created a new industry for girls and women because the straw bonnets could be made at home from local resources, so the women and girls could do work for themselves. Thus, Betsy Metcalf started the American straw-hat industry. Under the Patent Act of 1790 she could have sought a patent, but like most women at the time, who could not legally hold property, she chose not to. Mary Kies, however, broke that pattern on May 5, 1809. Dolley Madison was so pleased by Kies' innovation that she sent a personal letter applauding her.\\nKies' technique proved valuable in making cost-effective work bonnets. In so doing, she bolstered New England's hat economy, which had been faltering due to the Embargo Act of 1807. However, a change in the fashion of the day made her unable to profit from her invention and she died penniless in 1837. Her original patent file was destroyed in an 1836 fire at the United States Patent Office.\\n\\nLegacy\\nIn 2006, she was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\"), (1123, ''), (1124, ''), (1125, 'Anne Klein (August 3, 1923 - March 19, 1974) was an American fashion designer.

She has been called \"the most famous 19th-century woman inventor\".\\n\\nEarly life\\nMargaret Knight was born on February 14, 1838, in York, Maine to James Knight and Hannah Teal. After her father died when she was young, Knight\\'s family moved to Manchester, New Hampshire. She received a basic education, but left school with her siblings to work at a cotton mill. At the age of 12, Knight witnessed an accident at the mill where a worker was stabbed by a steel-tipped shuttle that shot out of a mechanical loom. Within weeks she invented a safety device for the loom that was later adopted by other Manchester mills. The device was never patented and the exact nature of it is unknown, though it may have been either a device to stop the loom when the shuttle thread broke or a guard to physically block a flying shuttle. Health problems precluded Knight from continuing work at the cotton mill and in her teens and early 20s she held several jobs, including home repair, photography and engraving.\\n\\nCareer\\nKnight moved to Springfield, Massachusetts in 1867 and was hired by the Columbia Paper Bag Company. In 1868, Knight invented a machine that folded and glued paper to form the flat-bottomed brown paper bags familiar to shoppers today. Knight built a wooden model of the device, but needed a working iron model to apply for a patent. Charles Annan, who was in the machine shop where Knight\\'s iron model was being built, stole her design and patented the device. Knight filed a successful patent interference lawsuit and was awarded the patent in 1871. With a Massachusetts business partner, Knight established the Eastern Paper Bag Co. and received royalties.\\nHer many other inventions included lid removing pliers, a numbering machine, a window frame and sash, patented in 1894, and several devices relating to rotary engines, patented between 1902 and 1915.\\n\\nLater life and legacy\\nKnight never married and died on October 12, 1914, at the age of 76.\\nA plaque recognizing her as the \"first woman awarded a U.S. patent\" and holder of 87 U.S. patents hangs on the Curry Cottage at 287 Hollis St in Framingham.

She is best known for inventing the first of a family of synthetic fibres of exceptional strength and stiffness: poly-paraphenylene terephthalamide—better known as Kevlar. For her discovery, Kwolek was awarded the DuPont company\\'s Lavoisier Medal for outstanding technical achievement. As of February 2015, she was the only female employee to have received that honor. In 1995 she became the fourth woman to be added to the National Inventors Hall of Fame. Kwolek won numerous awards for her work in polymer chemistry, including the National Medal of Technology, the IRI Achievement Award and the Perkin Medal.\\n\\nEarly life and education\\nKwolek was born to Polish immigrant parents in the Pittsburgh suburb of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, in 1923. Her father, John Kwolek (Polish: Jan Chwałek), died when she was ten years old. He was a naturalist by avocation, and Kwolek spent hours with him, as a child, exploring the natural world. She attributed her interest in science to him and an interest in fashion to her mother, Nellie (Zajdel) Kwolek.\\nIn 1946, Kwolek earned a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in chemistry from Margaret Morrison Carnegie College of Carnegie Mellon University. She had planned to become a doctor and hoped she could earn enough money from a temporary job in a chemistry-related field to attend medical school.\\n\\nDuPont career\\nHale Charch, a future mentor, offered Kwolek a position at DuPont\\'s Buffalo, New York, facility in 1946,. This vacancy was due to men being overseas in World War II.\\nKwolek only intended to work for DuPont temporarily, to raise money to study medicine. When she found the work interesting, she decided to stay and moved to Wilmington, Delaware, in 1950 with DuPont. She created Kevlar after ten years with the company.  In 1959, she won a publication award from the American Chemical Society (ACS), the first of many awards.  The paper, The Nylon Rope Trick, demonstrated a way of producing nylon in a beaker at room temperature. It is still a common classroom experiment, and the process was extended to high molecular weight polyamides. In 1985, Kwolek and coworkers patented a method for preparing PBO and PBT polymers.\\n\\nKevlar\\nWhile working for DuPont, Kwolek invented Kevlar. In 1964, in anticipation of a gasoline shortage, her group began searching for a lightweight yet strong fibre to be used in tires. The polymers she had been working with at the time, poly-p-phenylene terephthalate and polybenzamide, formed liquid crystal while in solution that at the time had to be melt-spun at over 200 °C (392 °F), which produced weaker and less stiff fibres. A unique technique in her new projects and the melt-condensation polymerization process was to reduce those temperatures to between 0 and 40 °C (32 and 104 °F).\\nAs she later explained in a 1993 speech:\\n\\nThe solution was unusually (low viscosity), turbid, stir-opalescent and buttermilk in appearance. Conventional polymer solutions are usually clear or translucent and have the viscosity of molasses, more or less. The solution that I prepared looked like a dispersion but was totally filterable through a fine pore filter. This was a liquid crystalline solution, but I did not know it at the time.\\n\\nThis sort of cloudy solution usually was thrown away. However, Kwolek persuaded technician Charles Smullen, who ran the spinneret, to test her solution. She was amazed to find that the new fiber would not break when nylon typically would. Not only was it stronger than nylon, Kevlar was five times stronger than steel by weight. Both her supervisor and the laboratory director understood the significance of her discovery, and a new field of polymer chemistry quickly arose. By 1971, modern Kevlar was introduced. Kwolek learned that the fibers could be made even stronger by heat-treating them. The polymer molecules, shaped like rods or matchsticks, are highly oriented, which gives Kevlar its extraordinary strength. Kwolek continued research of thermotropic Kevlar derivatives containing aliphatic and chlorine groups.\\n\\nApplications of Kevlar\\nKwolek was not very involved in developing practical applications of Kevlar. Once senior DuPont managers were informed of the discovery, they immediately assigned a whole group to work on different aspects,\" she said. Still, Kwolek continued chemistry investigations of Kevlar derivatives for DuPont. She also did not profit from DuPont\\'s products, as she signed over the Kevlar patent to the company.\\nKevlar is used as a material in more than 200 applications, including tennis rackets, skis, parachute lines, boats, airplanes, ropes, cables, and bullet-proof vests. It has been used for car tires, fire fighter boots, hockey sticks, cut-resistant gloves and armored cars. It has also been used for protective building materials like bomb-proof materials, hurricane safe rooms, and bridge reinforcements. During the week of Kwolek\\'s death, the one millionth bullet-resistant vest made with Kevlar was sold. Kevlar is also used to build cellular telephones; Motorola\\'s Droid RAZR has a Kevlar unibody.\\n\\nAwards and honors\\nFor her discovery of Kevlar, Kwolek was awarded the DuPont company\\'s Lavoisier Medal for outstanding technical achievement in 1995, as a \"Persistent experimentalist and role model whose discovery of liquid crystalline polyamides led to Kevlar aramid fibers.\" At the time of her death in 2014, she was still the only female employee to receive that honor. Her discovery generated several billion dollars of revenue for DuPont, being her employer at the time, but she never benefited directly from it financially.\\nIn 1980, Kwolek received the Chemical Pioneer Award from the American Institute of Chemists, and an Award for Creative Invention from the American Chemical Society. In 1995, Kwolek was added to the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In 1996, she received the National Medal of Technology and the IRI Achievement Award. In 1997, she received the Perkin Medal from the American Chemical Society. In 2003, she was added to the National Women\\'s Hall of Fame.\\nShe has been awarded honorary degrees by Carnegie Mellon University (2001), Worcester Polytechnic Institute (1981) and Clarkson University (1997).\\n\\nThe Royal Society of Chemistry grants a biennial \\'Stephanie L Kwolek Award\\', \"to recognise exceptional contributions to the area of materials chemistry from a scientist working outside the UK\".\\nKwolek is featured as one of the Royal Society of Chemistry 175 Faces of Chemistry.\\n\\nRetirement\\nIn 1986, Kwolek retired as a research associate for DuPont. Toward the end of her life, she consulted for DuPont, and served on both the National Research Council and the National Academy of Sciences. During her 40 years as a research scientist, she filed and received either 17 or 28 patents.\\nShe often tutored students in chemistry. She has also invented and wrote about numerous classroom demonstrations that are still used in schools today, such as the Nylon Rope Trick.\\nKwolek died at the age of 90 on June 18, 2014.\\n\\nReferences\\nFurther reading\\nEdwin Brit Wyckoff (April 2008), Stopping Bullets with a Thread; Stephanie Kwolek and Her Incredible Invention, Enslow Elementary, ISBN 9780766028500, OCLC 74029319, 076602850X\\n\\nExternal links\\n Media related to Stephanie Kwolek at Wikimedia Commons\\nStephanie Kwolek at Famous Women Inventors\\n\"Women in Chemistry – Stephanie Kwolek (Video)\".

Traveling to London, she met Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio head Louis B. Mayer, who offered her a movie contract in Hollywood, where she became a film star from the late 1930s to the 1950s.\\nAmong Lamarr\\'s best known films are Algiers (1938), Boom Town (1940), I Take This Woman (1940), Comrade X (1940), Come Live With Me (1941), H.M. Pulham, Esq. (1941), and Samson and Delilah (1949).\\nLamarr is also credited with being an inventor. At the beginning of World War II, she and composer George Antheil developed a radio guidance system for Allied torpedoes, which used spread spectrum and frequency hopping technology to defeat the threat of jamming by the Axis powers. Although the US Navy did not adopt the technology until the 1960s, the principles of their work are arguably incorporated into Bluetooth technology, and are similar to methods used in legacy versions of CDMA and Wi-Fi. This work led to their induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2014.\\nLamarr was married six times, bearing two sons and a daughter.\\n\\nEarly life\\nLamarr was born Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler in 1914 in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, the only child of Gertrud \"Trude\" Kiesler (née Lichtwitz; 1894–1977) and Emil Kiesler (1880–1935). Her father was born to a Jewish family in Lemberg (now Lviv in Ukraine) and was a successful bank director.\\nTrude, her mother, a pianist and Budapest native, had come from an upper-class Jewish family. She had converted to Catholicism and was described as a \"practicing Christian\" who raised her daughter as a Christian. Lamarr helped get her mother out of Austria after it had been absorbed by the Third Reich and to the United States, where Gertrude later became an American citizen. She put \"Hebrew\" as her race on her petition for naturalization, which was a term often used in Europe.\\n\\nEuropean film career\\nEarly work\\nIn the late 1920s, Lamarr was discovered as an actress and brought to Berlin by producer Max Reinhardt. Following her training in the theater, she returned to Vienna to work in the film industry, first as a script girl, and soon as an actress.\\nHer rise to European stardom was rapid. She was an extra in Money on the Street (1930) and had a small role in Storm in a Water Glass (1931). She had a bigger part in The Trunks of Mr. O.F. (1931), starring Walter Abel and Peter Lorre, then was given the lead role in No Money Needed (1932), a comedy directed by Carl Boese. Lamarr then starred in the film which made her internationally famous.\\n\\nEcstasy\\nIn early 1933, at age 18, Lamarr was given the lead in Gustav Machatý\\'s film, Ecstasy (Ekstase in German, Extase in Czech). She played the neglected young wife of an indifferent older man.\\nThe film became both celebrated and notorious for showing Lamarr\\'s face in the throes of orgasm as well as close-up and brief nude scenes, a result of her being \"duped\" by the director and producer, who used high-power telephoto lenses.\\nAlthough she was dismayed and now disillusioned about taking other roles, the film gained world recognition after winning an award in Rome. Throughout Europe, it was regarded an artistic work. But in America it was considered overly sexual and received negative publicity, especially among women\\'s groups. It was banned there and in Germany.\\n\\nWithdrawal\\nLamarr played a number of stage roles, including a starring one in Sissy, a play about Austrian royalty produced in Vienna. It won accolades from critics. Admirers sent roses to her dressing room and tried to get backstage to meet her. She sent most of them away, including a man who was more insistent, Friedrich Mandl. He became obsessed with getting to know her.\\nMandl was an Austrian military arms merchant and munitions manufacturer who was reputedly the third-richest man in Austria. She fell for his charming and fascinating personality, partly due to his immense financial wealth. Her parents, both of Jewish descent, did not approve, due to Mandl\\'s ties to Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini, and later, German führer Adolf Hitler. But they could not stop the headstrong Hedy.\\nOn August 10, 1933, Lamarr married Mandl. She was 18 years old and he was 33. In her autobiography Ecstasy and Me, she described Mandl as an extremely controlling husband who strongly objected to her simulated orgasm scene in Ecstasy and prevented her from pursuing her acting career. She claimed she was kept a virtual prisoner in their castle home, Schloss Schwarzenau.\\nMandl had close social and business ties to the Italian government, selling munitions to the country, and although like Hedy, his own father was Jewish, had ties to the Nazi regime of Germany, as well. Lamarr wrote that the dictators of both countries attended lavish parties at the Mandl home. Lamarr accompanied Mandl to business meetings, where he conferred with scientists and other professionals involved in military technology. These conferences were her introduction to the field of applied science and nurtured her latent talent in science.\\nLamarr\\'s marriage to Mandl eventually became unbearable, and she decided to separate herself from both her husband and country. In her autobiography, she wrote that she disguised herself as her maid and fled to Paris, but by other accounts, she persuaded Mandl to let her wear all of her jewelry for a dinner party, then disappeared afterward. She writes about her marriage:\\n\\nI knew very soon that I could never be an actress while I was his wife.... He was the absolute monarch in his marriage.... I was like a doll. I was like a thing, some object of art which had to be guarded—and imprisoned—having no mind, no life of its own.\\n\\nHollywood career\\nLouis B. Mayer and MGM\\nAfter arriving in London in 1937, she met Louis B. Mayer, head of MGM, who was scouting for talent in Europe. Mayer persuaded her to change her name to Hedy Lamarr (to distance herself from her real identity, and \"the Ecstasy lady\" reputation associated with it)), choosing the surname in homage to the beautiful silent film star, Barbara La Marr. He brought her to Hollywood in 1938 and began promoting her as the \"world\\'s most beautiful woman\".\\nMayer loaned Lamarr to producer Walter Wanger, who was making Algiers (1938), an American version of the French film, Pépé le Moko (1937). Lamarr was cast in the lead opposite Charles Boyer. The film created a \"national sensation\", says Shearer. She was billed as an unknown but well-publicized Austrian actress, which created anticipation in audiences. Mayer hoped she would become another Greta Garbo or Marlene Dietrich. According to one viewer, when her face first appeared on the screen, \"everyone gasped...Lamarr\\'s beauty literally took one\\'s breath away.\"\\nIn future Hollywood films, she was invariably typecast as the archetypal glamorous seductress of exotic origin. Her second American film was to be I Take This Woman, co-starring with Spencer Tracy under the direction of regular Dietrich collaborator, Josef von Sternberg. Von Sternberg was fired during the shoot, replaced by Frank Borzage. The film was put on hold, and Lamarr was put into Lady of the Tropics (1939), where she played a mixed-race seductress in Saigon opposite Robert Taylor. She returned to I Take This Woman, re-shot by W. S. Van Dyke. The resulting film was a flop.\\nFar more popular was Boom Town (1940) with Clark Gable, Claudette Colbert and Spencer Tracy - it made $5 million. MGM promptly reteamed Lamarr and Gable in Comrade X (1940), a comedy film in the vein of Ninotchka (1939), which was another hit.\\nLamarr was teamed with James Stewart in Come Live with Me (1941), playing a Viennese refugee. Stewart was also in Ziegfeld Girl (1941), where Lamarr, Judy Garland and Lana Turner played aspiring showgirls - a big success.\\nLamarr was top-billed in H. M. Pulham, Esq. (1941), although the film\\'s protagonist was the title role played by Robert Young. She made a third film with Tracy, Tortilla Flat (1942). It was successful at the box office, as was Crossroads (1942) with William Powell.\\nLamarr played the seductive native girl Tondelayo in White Cargo (1942), top billed over Walter Pidgeon. It was a huge hit. White Cargo contains arguably her most memorable film quote, delivered with provocative invitation: \"I am Tondelayo. I make tiffin for you?\" This line typifies many of Lamarr\\'s roles, which emphasized her beauty and sensuality while giving her relatively few lines. The lack of acting challenges bored Lamarr. She reportedly took up inventing to relieve her boredom.\\nShe was reunited with Powell in a comedy The Heavenly Body (1944), then was borrowed by Warner Bros for The Conspirators (1944). This was an attempt to repeat the success of Casablanca (1943), and RKO borrowed her for a melodrama Experiment Perilous (1944).\\nBack at MGM Lamarr was teamed with Robert Walker in the romantic comedy Her Highness and the Bellboy (1945), playing a princess who falls in love with a New Yorker. It was very popular, but would be the last film she made under her MGM contract.\\nHer off-screen life and personality during those years was quite different from her screen image. She spent much of her time feeling lonely and homesick. She might swim at her agent\\'s pool, but shunned the beaches and staring crowds. When asked for an autograph, she wondered why anyone would want it. Writer Howard Sharpe interviewed her and gave his impression:\\n\\nHedy has the most incredible personal sophistication. She knows the peculiarly European art of being womanly; she knows what men want in a beautiful woman, what attracts them, and she forces herself to be these things. She has magnetism with warmth, something that neither Dietrich nor Garbo has managed to achieve.\\n\\nAuthor Richard Rhodes describes her assimilation into American culture:\\n\\nOf all the European émigrés who escaped Nazi Germany and Nazi Austria, she was one of the very few who succeeded in moving to another culture and becoming a full-fledged star herself. There were so very few who could make the transition linguistically or culturally. She really was a resourceful human being–I think because of her father\\'s strong influence on her as a child.\\n\\nWartime fundraiser\\nLamarr wanted to join the National Inventors Council, but was reportedly told by NIC member Charles F. Kettering and others that she could better help the war effort by using her celebrity status to sell war bonds.\\nShe participated in a war bond-selling campaign with a sailor named Eddie Rhodes. Rhodes was in the crowd at each Lamarr appearance, and she would call him up on stage. She would briefly flirt with him before asking the audience if she should give him a kiss. The crowd would say yes, to which Hedy would reply that she would if enough people bought war bonds. After enough bonds were purchased, she would kiss Rhodes and he would head back into the audience. Then they would head off to the next war bond rally.\\n\\nProducer\\nAfter leaving MGM in 1945, Lamarr formed a production company with Jack Chertok and made the thriller The Strange Woman (1946). It went over budget and only made minor profits.\\nShe and Chertok then made Dishonored Lady (1947), another thriller starring Lamar, which also went over budget - but was not a commercial success. She tried a comedy with Robert Cummings, Let\\'s Live a Little (1948).\\n\\nLater films\\nLamarr enjoyed her biggest success playing Delilah against Victor Mature as the Biblical strongman in Cecil B. DeMille\\'s Samson and Delilah, the highest-grossing film of 1949. The film also won two Oscars.\\nLamarr returned to MGM for a film noir with John Hodiak, A Lady Without Passport (1950), which flopped. More popular were two pictures she made at Paramount, a Western with Ray Milland, Copper Canyon (1950), and a Bob Hope spy spoof, My Favorite Spy (1951).\\n\\nHer career went into decline. She went to Italy to play multiple roles in Loves of Three Queens (1954), which she also produced.\\nShe was Joan of Arc in Irwin Allen\\'s critically panned epic, The Story of Mankind (1957) and did episodes of Zane Grey Theatre (\"Proud Woman\") and Shower of Stars (\"Cloak and Dagger\"). Her last film was a thriller The Female Animal (1958).\\n\\nInventor\\nAlthough Lamarr had no formal training and was primarily self-taught, she worked in her spare time on various hobbies and inventions, which included an improved traffic stoplight and a tablet that would dissolve in water to create a carbonated drink. The beverage was unsuccessful; Lamarr herself said it tasted like Alka-Seltzer. An unrelated effort resulted in Fizzies, which became a cultural icon of the 1950s-60s.\\n\\nAmong the few who knew of Lamarr\\'s inventiveness was aviation tycoon Howard Hughes. Lamarr discussed her relationship with Hughes during an interview, saying that while they dated, he actively supported her \"tinkering\" hobbies. He put his team of science engineers at her disposal, saying they would do or make anything she asked for.\\nDuring World War II, Lamarr learned that radio-controlled torpedoes, an emerging technology in naval war, could easily be jammed and set off course. She thought of creating a frequency-hopping signal that could not be tracked or jammed. She contacted her friend, composer and pianist George Antheil, to help her develop a device for doing that, and he succeeded by synchronizing a miniaturized player-piano mechanism with radio signals. They drafted designs for the frequency-hopping system, which they patented. Antheil recalled:\\n\\nWe began talking about the war, which, in the late summer of 1940, was looking most extremely black. Hedy said that she did not feel very comfortable, sitting there in Hollywood and making lots of money when things were in such a state. She said that she knew a good deal about munitions and various secret weapons ... and that she was thinking seriously of quitting MGM and going to Washington, DC, to offer her services to the newly established Inventors\\' Council.\\n\\nTheir invention was granted a patent on August 11, 1942 (filed using her married name Hedy Kiesler Markey). However, it was technologically difficult to implement, and at that time the U.S. Navy was not receptive to considering inventions coming from outside the military.\\nIn 1962 (at the time of the Cuban missile crisis), an updated version of their design at last appeared on Navy ships. Lamarr and Antheil\\'s work with spread spectrum technology contributed to the development of Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi.\\nIn 1997, they received the Electronic Frontier Foundation Pioneer Award and the Bulbie Gnass Spirit of Achievement Bronze Award, given to individuals whose creative lifetime achievements in the arts, sciences, business, or invention fields have significantly contributed to society. Lamarr was featured on the Science Channel and the Discovery Channel. In 2014, Lamarr and Antheil were posthumously inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.\\n\\nLater years\\nLamarr became a naturalized citizen of the United States at age 38 on April 10, 1953. Her autobiography, Ecstasy and Me, was published in 1966, although she said on TV that it was not written by her, and much of it was fictional. Lamarr later sued the publisher, saying that many details were fabricated by its ghost writer, Leo Guild. Lamarr, in turn, was sued by Gene Ringgold, who asserted that the book plagiarized material from an article he had written in 1965 for Screen Facts magazine.\\nIn 1966, Lamarr was arrested in Los Angeles for shoplifting. The charges were eventually dropped. In 1991, she was arrested on the same charge in Florida, this time for stealing $21.48 worth of laxatives and eye drops. She pleaded \"no contest\" to avoid a court appearance, and the charges were dropped in return for her promise to refrain from breaking any laws for a year. The shoplifting charges coincided with a failed attempt to return to the screen.\\nThe 1970s were a decade of increasing seclusion for Lamarr. She was offered several scripts, television commercials, and stage projects, but none piqued her interest. In 1974, she filed a $10 million lawsuit against Warner Bros., claiming that the running parody of her name (\"Hedley Lamarr\") in the Mel Brooks comedy Blazing Saddles infringed her right to privacy. Brooks said he was flattered; the studio settled out of court for an undisclosed nominal sum and an apology to Lamarr for \"almost using her name\". Brooks said that Lamarr \"never got the joke\". With her eyesight failing, Lamarr retreated from public life and settled in Miami Beach, Florida, in 1981.\\nA large Corel-drawn image of Lamarr won CorelDRAW\\'s yearly software suite cover design contest in 1996. For several years, beginning in 1997, it was featured on boxes of the software suite. Lamarr sued the company for using her image without her permission. Corel countered that she did not own rights to the image. The parties reached an undisclosed settlement in 1998.\\nFor her contribution to the motion picture industry, Lamarr has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6247 Hollywood Blvd adjacent to Vine Street where the walk is centered.\\nIn her later years, Lamarr turned to plastic surgery to preserve the looks she was terrified of losing, but the results were disastrous. \"She had her breasts enlarged, her cheeks raised, her lips made bigger, and much, much more,\" said her son, Anthony. \"She had plastic surgery thinking it could revive her looks and her career, but it backfired and distorted her beauty\". Anthony Loder claimed that Lamarr was addicted to pills.\\nLamarr became estranged from her other son, James Lamarr Loder, when he was 12 years old. Their relationship ended abruptly, and he moved in with another family. They did not speak again for almost 50 years. Lamarr left James Loder out of her will, and he sued for control of the US$3.3 million estate left by Lamarr in 2000. He eventually settled for US$50,000.\\n\\nSeclusion\\nIn the last decades of her life, the telephone became Lamarr\\'s only means of communication with the outside world, even with her children and close friends. She often talked up to six or seven hours a day on the phone, but she spent hardly any time with anyone in person in her final years. A documentary, Calling Hedy Lamarr, was released in 2004 and featured her children, Anthony Loder and Denise Loder-DeLuca.\\n\\nDeath\\nLamarr died in Casselberry, Florida, on January 19, 2000, of heart disease, aged 85. Her son Anthony Loder spread her ashes in Austria\\'s Vienna Woods in accordance with her last wishes.\\nLamarr was given an honorary grave in Vienna\\'s Central Cemetery in 2014.\\n\\nMarriages\\nLamarr was married and divorced six times:\\nFriedrich Mandl (married 1933–1937), chairman of the Hirtenberger Patronen-Fabrik\\nGene Markey (married 1939–1941), screenwriter and producer. She had a natural child James Lamarr (born January 9, 1939), her son with John Loder. Lamarr and Markey adopted the boy together, who was known as James Lamarr Markey. He was later adopted by Loder and was thereafter known as James Lamarr Loder. Lamarr and Markey lived at 2727 Benedict Canyon Drive in Beverly Hills, California during their marriage.\\nJohn Loder (married 1943–1947), actor, children: Denise Loder (born January 19, 1945), married Larry Colton, a writer and former baseball player; and Anthony Loder (born February 1, 1947), married Roxanne who worked for illustrator James McMullan. Anthony Loder was featured in the 2004 documentary film Calling Hedy Lamarr.\\nErnest \"Ted\" Stauffer (married 1951–1952), nightclub owner, restaurateur, and former bandleader\\nW. Howard Lee (married 1953–1960), a Texas oilman (who later married film actress Gene Tierney)\\nLewis J. Boies (married 1963–1965), Lamarr\\'s divorce lawyer\\nFollowing her sixth and final divorce in 1965, Lamarr remained unmarried for the last 35 years of her life.\\nThroughout, she claimed that James Lamarr Markey/Loder was biologically unrelated and adopted during her marriage to Gene Markey. However, years later James found documentation that he was the out-of-wedlock son of Lamarr and actor John Loder, whom she later married as her third husband. She had two more children with him: Denise (born 1945) and Anthony (born 1947) during their marriage.\\n\\nAwards\\nIn 1939, Lamarr was selected the \"most promising new actress\" of 1938 in a poll of area voters conducted by Philadelphia Record film critic. British moviegoers voted Hedy Lamarr the year\\'s 10th best actress, for her performance in Samson and Delilah in 1951.\\nIn 1997, Lamarr and George Anthiel were jointly honored with the Electronic Frontier Foundation\\'s Pioneer Award and Lamarr also was the first woman to receive the Invention Convention\\'s BULBIE Gnass Spirit of Achievement Award, known as the \"Oscars of inventing\".\\nIn 2014, Lamarr was posthumously inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame for frequency-hopping spread spectrum technology.\\n\\nFilmography\\nRadio appearances\\nIn popular culture\\nIn 2008, an off-Broadway play, Frequency Hopping, features the lives of Lamarr and Antheil. The play was written and staged by Elyse Singer, and the script won a prize for best new play about science and technology from STAGE.\\nIn 2010, Lamarr was selected out of 150 IT people to be featured in a short film launched by the British Computer Society on May 20.\\nAlso during 2010, the New York Public Library exhibit Thirty Years of Photography at the New York Public Library included a photo of a topless Lamarr (c.\\u20091930) by Austrian-born American photographer Trude Fleischmann.\\nIn 2011, the story of Lamarr\\'s frequency-hopping spread spectrum invention was explored in an episode of the Science Channel show Dark Matters: Twisted But True, a series that explores the darker side of scientific discovery and experimentation, which premiered on September 7. Her work in improving wireless security was part of the premiere episode of the Discovery Channel show How We Invented the World.\\nAlso during 2011, Anne Hathaway revealed that she had learned that the original Catwoman was based on Lamarr, so she studied all of Lamarr\\'s films and incorporated some of her breathing techniques into her portrayal of Catwoman in the 2012 film The Dark Knight Rises.\\nIn 2015, on November 9, the 101st anniversary of Lemarr\\'s birth, Google paid tribute to Hedy Lamarr\\'s work in film and her contributions to scientific advancement with an animated Google Doodle.\\nIn 2016, Lamarr was depicted in an off-Broadway play, HEDY! The Life and Inventions of Hedy Lamarr, a one-woman show written and performed by Heather Massie.\\nIn 2016, the off-Broadway, one-actor show \"Stand Still and Look Stupid: The Life Story of Hedy Lamarr.\" starring Emily Ebertz and written by Mike Broemmel went into production.  \\nAlso during 2016, the main villain in Agent Carter (set in late 1940s), Whitney Frost, was a character modeled after Lamarr.\\nIn 2017, actress Celia Massingham portrayed Lamarr on The CW television series Legends of Tomorrow in the sixth episode of the third season, titled Helen Hunt. The episode is set in 1937 Hollywoodland. The episode aired on November 14, 2017.\\nAlso during 2017, Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story, written and directed by Alexandra Dean and produced by Susan Sarandon, a documentary about Lamarr\\'s career as an actress and later as an inventor, premiered at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival. It was released in theaters on November 24, 2017, and aired on PBS American Masters in May 2018.\\nIn 2018, actress Alyssa Sutherland portrayed Lamarr on the NBC television series Timeless in the third episode of the second season, titled Hollywoodland.

Retrieved March 13, 2018.'), (1131, 'Esther Miriam Zimmer Lederberg (December 18, 1922 – November 11, 2006) was an American microbiologist and a pioneer of bacterial genetics. Notable contributions include the discovery of the bacterial virus λ, the transfer of genes between bacteria by specialized transduction, the development of replica plating, and the discovery of the bacterial fertility factor F (F plasmid).\\nLederberg also founded and directed the now-defunct Plasmid Reference Center at Stanford University, where she maintained, named, and distributed plasmids of many types, including those coding for antibiotic resistance, heavy metal resistance, virulence, conjugation, colicins, transposons, and other unknown factors.\\n\\nEarly years\\nEsther Miriam Zimmer was the first of two children born in the Bronx, New York, to David Zimmer and Pauline Geller Zimmer. Her brother, Benjamin Zimmer, followed in 1923. A child of the Great Depression, her lunch was often a piece of bread topped by the juice of a squeezed tomato.\\nZimmer thrived academically. She attended Evander Childs High School in the Bronx, receiving honors for French and graduating at the age of 16. In college, Zimmer initially wanted to study French or literature, but she switched her field of study to biochemistry against the recommendation of her teachers, who felt women struggled to get a career in the sciences. She worked as a research assistant at the New York Botanical Garden, engaging in research on Neurospora crassa with the plant pathologist Bernard Ogilvie Dodge. She received a bachelor\\'s degree in genetics at New York City\\'s Hunter College, graduating cum laude in 1942, at the age of 20.\\nAfter her graduation from Hunter, Zimmer went to work as a research assistant to Alexander Hollaender at the Carnegie Institution of Washington (later Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory), where she continued to work with N. crassa as well as publishing her first work in genetics. In 1944 she won a fellowship to Stanford University, working as an assistant to George Wells Beadle. She traveled west to California, and after a summer studying at Stanford University\\'s Hopkins Marine Station under Cornelius Van Niel, she entered a master\\'s program in genetics. Stanford awarded her a master\\'s degree in 1946. That same year, she married Joshua Lederberg, a professor at the University of Wisconsin.\\nLederberg next went to the University of Wisconsin to pursue a doctorate degree. From 1946 to 1949, she was awarded a predoctoral fellowship by the National Cancer Institute. Her thesis was \"Genetic control of mutability in the bacterium Escherichia coli.\" She completed her doctorate under the supervision of R. A. Brink, in 1950.\\n\\nContributions to microbiology and genetics\\nLederberg remained at the University of Wisconsin for most of the 1950s. It was there that she discovered lambda phage, did early research on the relationship between transduction and lambda phage lysogeny, discovered the E. coli F fertility factor with Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza (eventually publishing with Joshua Lederberg), devised the first successful implementation of replica plating with Joshua Lederberg, and helped discover and understand the genetic mechanisms of specialized transduction. These contributions laid the foundation for much of the genetics work done in the latter half of the twentieth century.\\n\\nλ bacteriophage and specialized transduction\\nEsther Lederberg was the first to isolate λ bacteriophage. She first reported the discovery in 1951 while she was a PhD student and later provided a detailed description in a 1953 paper in the journal Genetics. She was working with an E. coli K12 strain that had been mutagenized with ultraviolet light. When she incubated a mixture of the mutant strain with its parent E. coli K12 strain on an agar plate, she saw plaques, which were known to be caused by bacteriophages. The source of the bacteriophage was the parental K12 strain. The UV treatment had \"cured\" the bacteriophage from the mutant, making it sensitive to infection by the same bacteriophage that the parent produced. The bacteriophage was named λ.\\nLambda phage genetic material consists of a double-stranded DNA molecule with 5\\' twelve-base-pair sticky ends (cos sites), which permit circularization of the DNA molecule. It shows a lytic cycle and a lysogenic cycle. Studies on the control of these alternative cycles have been very important for our understanding of the regulation of gene transcription.\\nLambda phage is considered a \\'temperate bacteriophage\\': one whose genome incorporates with and replicates with that of the host bacterium. Uses for lambda include its application as a vector for the cloning of recombinant DNA; the use of its site-specific recombinase, int, for the shuffling of cloned DNAs by the \\'Gateway\\' method; and the application of its Red operon, including the proteins Red alpha (also called \\'exo\\'), beta, and gamma, in the DNA engineering method called recombineering.\\nHer 1950 lambda phage paper led to an understanding of specialized transduction.\\nA permanent exhibit in the \"DNAtrium\" of The Eli and Edythe L. Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology honors Esther M. Zimmer Lederberg as the discoverer of lambda phage.\\n\\nBacterial Fertility Factor F\\nThe Fertility Factor (also known as F Factor) is a bacterial DNA sequence that allows a bacterium to produce a sex pilus necessary for conjugation. The sequence contains 20 tra (for \"transfer\") genes and a number of other genetic sequences responsible for incompatibility, replication, and other functions. The F factor is carried on an episome, which can either exist as an independent plasmid or integrate into the bacterial cell\\'s genome.\\nEsther Lederberg\\'s discovery of F stemmed directly from her experiments to map the location of lambda prophage on the E. coli chromosome by crosses with other E. coli strains with known genetic markers. When some of the crosses failed to give rise to recombinants, she suspected that some of her E. coli strains had lost a \"fertility factor.\" In her own words:\\n\\nIn terms of testing available markers ... the data showed that there was a specific locus for lysogenicity. ... In the course of such linkage [genetic mapping] studies,...one day, ZERO recombinants were recovered....I explored the notion that there was some sort of \\'fertility factor\\' which if absent, resulted in no recombinants. For short, I named this F. A number of experiments were designed to clarify these observations.\\n\\nReplica plating\\nAlthough there were other less efficient forerunners to the methodology (such as paper, or multipronged arrays using wire brushes, toothpicks, etc.), the problem of reproducing bacterial colonies en masse in the same geometric configuration as on original agar plate was first successfully solved by replica plating, as implemented by Esther M. Zimmer Lederberg.\\nScientists had been struggling for a reliable solution for at least a decade before Esther Lederberg finally implemented it successfully.\\nAllan Campbell, Eugene Nester and Stanley Falkow all recount how Esther Lederberg provided them with the technical information necessary to successfully use this new methodology. From Alan Campbell:\\n\\nWho successfully implemented the technique? Here Esther at least refined the process considerably. I remember (from her and others) that she was the one who went to the fabrics store and selected velvet of the best thickness, pile, etc. to give the cleanest prints.\\n\\nEugene Nester said:\\n\\nI wanted to respond to your question about replica plating and who really invented it. I think it will be very difficult to answer that question in a convincing way. That technique was developed before I ever knew the Lederbergs ... I do know that Esther in all likelihood was responsible for getting the technique to actually work. She emphasized to me how important it was to use a particular kind of Italian velvet (or was it velveteen actually), so in my own mind I believe she was the key person in taking the idea to actual practice.\\n\\nIn Falkow\\'s case, this happened a few years after she first published the replica plating paper. At the memorial for Esther Lederberg, he spoke of the impact of replica plating, and his feelings upon meeting the originator of the technique:\\n\\nIt was brilliantly simple: creative discoveries often are. She thought of using ordinary velveteen from a yard goods store to serve as a kind of rubber stamp. The tiny fibers of the velveteen acted like hundreds of tiny inocculating needles. The pad was carefully kept in the same orientation and used to inocculate a series of agar plates containing different media containing antibiotics or supplemented with essential nutrients such as amino acids and vitamins. Esther and Joshua used this technique as an indirect selective method to prove the spontaneous origin of mutants with adaptive advantages. ...\\n\\nAll of these things foreshadowed our first meeting and I was appropriately in awe of her. I was just starting to use replica plating in my own work and Esther immediately told me what brand of velveteen to look for and to be sure to wash the velveteen before I used them and even what detergent to use to wash them.\\n\\nLater contributions\\nEsther Lederberg returned to Stanford in 1959 with Joshua Lederberg. She remained at Stanford for the balance of her research career, founding and directing the Plasmid Reference Center (PRC) at the Stanford School of Medicine from 1976 to 1986.\\nAt first, plasmids were of great interest due to their ability to confer inheritable resistance to antibiotics, thus were referred to as \"R-Factors\" or \"R plasmids\". As time passed, the nomenclature was changed to \"Plasmids\" (in general) to take into account other factors in addition to antibiotic resistance, such as genes for specific activity (gal, lac, ara, etc.) and temperature sensitivity. (For example, plasmid pSC304 used Kretschmer\\'s protocol to establish temperature sensitivity. See P. J. Kretschmer and S. N. Cohen, 1977, J. Bacteriol., 130, 888-899.)\\nThe PRC coordinated closely with the members of the Plasmid Nomenclature Committee (Royston Clowes, Stanley N. Cohen, Rob Curtiss III, Naomi Datta, Stanley Falkow, and Richard P. Novick), assigning prefixes to plasmids, and numbers to Insertion Sequences and Transposons.\\nShe retired from her position in the Stanford Department of Microbiology and Immunology in 1985, but continued to run the PRC for almost another full decade after that.\\n\\nProfessional honors\\n1956 Society of Illinois Bacteriologists: Pasteur Award (with Joshua Lederberg)\\n1959 Fulbright Fellowship in bacteriology to work at Melbourne University in Australia.\\n1969 American Cancer Society Dernham Postdoctoral Fellowship in Oncology (Senior Fellowship)\\nFellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science\\nPresident of the Stanford Chapter of Sigma Xi\\nIn 1985, Lederberg was honored as an emeritus professor in microbiology and immunology at Stanford University.\\nIn 2010, Stanford University dedicated part of Clark Walk to Esther M. Zimmer Lederberg. (Clark Walk is a series of granite blocks that memorialize various Stanford scientists and events in the history of the Stanford School of Medicine, located between the Sherman Fairchild building and the Li Ka Shing Pavilion.)\\nA black granite block shows a photograph of Esther Lederberg in the laboratory, a page from one of her notebooks, and quotes from two close colleagues:\\nLen Herzenberg:\\n\\nJoshua and Esther Lederberg established their own group and worked on bacterial genetics. Studying with Edward Tatum, they discovered sex, or genetic exchange in bacteria, which won him the Nobel Prize shortly after he arrived at Stanford. The process they developed became a way to transfer genetic information between bacteria.\\n\\nStanley Falkow:\\n\\nEsther Lederberg developed a method of replica plating using velveteen attached to a piston ring. The rings are pressed onto bacterial colonies and then stamped onto a series of plates. She advanced many of the early lab procedures and also discovered lambda phage, which became a widely used tool in microbial genetics.\\n\\nProfessional challenges: gender discrimination\\nStanley Falkow said of Esther Lederberg that \"Experimentally and methodologically she was a genius in the lab.\" However, although Esther Lederberg was a pioneer research scientist, she faced significant challenges as a woman scientist in the 1950s and 1960s.\\nLederberg was excluded from writing a chapter in the 1966 book Phage and the Origins of Molecular Biology, a commemoration of molecular biology. According to the science historian Prina Abir-Am, her exclusion was \"incomprehensible\" because of her important discoveries in bacteriophage genetics. Abir-Am attributed her exclusion in part to the sexism that prevailed during the 1960s.\\nAs Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza later wrote, \"Dr. Esther Lederberg has enjoyed the privilege of working with a very famous husband. This has been at times also a setback, because inevitably she has not been credited with as much of the credit as she really deserved. I know that very few people, if any, have had the benefit of as valuable a co-worker as Joshua has had.\"\\nEsther Lederberg had to fight to gain a position on the Stanford faculty. Retained as a Senior Scientist, in 1974 she was forced to transition to a position as Adjunct Professor of Medical Microbiology \"coterminous with research support.\" (Adjunct Professors are typically un-tenured.)\\nAllan Campbell noted the injustice of Stanford\\'s attitude toward women scientists in a letter of recommendation for Esther Lederberg, written in 1971: \"I think she is a definite asset to the University and merits promotion according to the normal customs of your department (i.e., that your Committee on Women\\'s Promotions should recommend advancement on the same time schedule as a Committee of Men\\'s Promotions would advance a male scientist).\"\\n\\nOther interests\\nEsther Lederberg had cultural interests that went well beyond science.\\n\\nMusic\\nA lifelong musician, Lederberg was a devotee of early music. She was one of the founding members of the Mid-Peninsula Recorder Orchestra (affiliated with the San Francisco Early Music Society) in 1962, serving as its president for several years. At the memorial held for Dr. Lederberg at Stanford University, Frederick Palmer, musical director of the Mid-Peninsula Recorder Orchestra, spoke of Esther\\'s joy in this music, and her dedication to the MPRO:\\n\\nOne of the frustrations of anyone directing a musical ensemble made up of volunteers is wondering who will show up for rehearsals and if all of the parts will be adequately covered. I never had to worry about Esther. Even after her health began to fail and she was required to use a walker, Esther seldom missed one of the orchestra\\'s meetings, and she insisted on playing in the concerts that the orchestra presented despite her limited mobility.\\n\\nAlways conscious that much of early music was really dance music, Lederberg also studied Renaissance and Elizabethan dance.\\nShe loved symphonic music, opera, and the operettas of Gilbert and Sullivan.\\n\\nLiterature\\nEsther\\'s taste in literature was eclectic; her library included both classics and contemporary works by such authors as Gore Vidal, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Margaret Atwood. A scientist who could suspend disbelief enough to actually enjoy science fiction, Esther nevertheless took issue with Michael Crichton\\'s handling of the alien antagonist in his novel The Andromeda Strain. Her second husband, Matthew Simon, recounts:\\n\\nEsther commented that \"Crichton never got it right.\" I asked her what she meant, and she replied that if an extraterrestrial life form were caught in an outer space probe and brought back to Earth, whatever would counteract it would with high probability be caught along with it in the same probe, because living things are always surrounded in their environment by those things that counteract it. \"They should simply have looked in the same net,\" she said. \"They would have found what they needed to control the alien life form.\"\\n\\nLederberg also loved the works of Charles Dickens and Jane Austen. She belonged to societies devoted to studying and celebrating these two authors, the Dickens Society of Palo Alto and the Jane Austen Society.\\n\\nBotany and botanical gardens\\nLederberg maintained a lifelong love of botany and botanical gardens. She encouraged the planting of indigenous plants such as poppies and lupins around the Stanford University campus, arguing that besides being beautiful, such plants would not need to be watered—an important consideration on a campus located in the San Francisco Bay Area, which experiences frequent droughts.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nShe married Joshua Lederberg in 1946; they divorced in 1968. She married Matthew Simon in 1993.\\nShe died November 11, 2006, from pneumonia and congestive heart failure, at the age of 83.\\n\\nNotable papers\\nFor a list of all known papers authored or co-authored by Esther M.

In 1948, she invented Capri pants.\\n\\nEarly life\\nSonja de Lennart was born in 1920 into a multicultural family and is the daughter of an industrialist and syndicus. In her youth, she was a keen athlete in swimming and track and field. By the age of eight, de Lennart had already won many swimming competitions. In 1932, she participated in the official National Youth Competitions as an athlete in track and field running the 100 m and 1000 m sprint. She was an active member of the Classic Theater Society along with being a talented student of the Breslau State Opera ballet whose teacher was the famous dancer and ballet master, Anna Capana.\\nAfter attending business college in Breslau, her dream of becoming a fashion designer became a passion. She studied design despite her father’s extremely strong opposition and threat of disinheritance. She secretly enrolled as a student apprentice at Erich Boehm Atelier and later at Herman Palm Atelier in Berlin in which she studied the skillful trade of tailoring and the customizing of garments – from elegant hats to evening gowns – until she became a master craftsman of her trade graduating as a textile engineer. After World War II, she was entered as a member into the prestigious Handwerksrolle of the Chamber of Trade. After the political regime had destroyed the family fortune, it was de Lennart who, after World War II, restored her family financially with her fashion design trade.\\n\\nFashion career\\nIn 1945, after the war, Sonja de Lennart began to produce fashion wear and opened her first boutique, Salon Sonja, in Munich. Her fashion career began with a rare but fortunate circumstance when the fashion advisor of the Taylor’s Guild, M. Ponater, allowed de Lennart to exhibit one of her first creations (a hand painted dress which she painted herself and displayed on a mannequin) in one corner of Ponater’s booth of the leading Fashion Trade Fair, Handwerksmesse, where he was displaying and selling his own fashion collection. This one and only opportunity to show her talent had customers standing in line to place orders for which she wasn’t prepared. This event turned into the beginning of the distribution of de Lennart’s creations. The demand for her designs was so overwhelming that soon after, the family began to manufacture another of her creations, imitation leather vestures, as well as three-quarter length coats that were exhibited at the Craftsman Fair and distributed nationwide becoming a bestseller.\\nIn that same year, she created a wide-swinging skirt with a wide belt (which she modeled herself), a blouse, and hat. Her design collection became known as the Capri Collection. She chose this name as it was her family’s love for the island of Capri that captivated her together with a recorded song sent to her by her family in America called, \"Isle of Capri\". Her love for this song and her increased fondness for the Island of Capri, gave her the inspiration of the Capri name.\\nIn 1948, after years of women wearing the typical wide and rather masculine pants, de Lennart created the sexy tight three-quarter length Capri pants with the stylish short slit on the outer-side of the pant leg. The original classic Capri Pants were designed in specific lengths for winter and summer wear. In 1949, German actress, Mady Rahl, and Austrian actress, Erni Mangold, both posed for Sonja de Lennart in the original summer- and winter-style Capri pant, respectively.\\nIn 1952, Edith Head recognized the innovative and revolutionary style of Sonja de Lennart and had her Capri Collection [the wide-swinging Capri skirt, the high-neck Capri blouse, and the wide Capri belt and Capri pants] sewn by the Italian Fontana sisters for Audrey Hepburn in the movie, Roman Holiday. In 1953, Hubert de Givenchy had de Lennart’s Capri pants stitched for Audrey Hepburn, which she wore in the movie Sabrina (1954).\\nEdith Head introduced the Capri skirt, Capri blouse, Capri pants, and Capri belt to the world; but, it was the Capri pants that made history. Among the many who have worn the fashionable Capri pants are Doris Day, Jane Russell, Katharine Hepburn, Gina Lollobrigida, Ava Gardner, Elizabeth Taylor, Jacqueline Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe, Kim Novak, Sophia Loren, Anita Ekberg, and Mary Tyler Moore. Capri pants marched even in the Existentialist Bars from Saint-Germain-des-Prés in Paris: “Young women loved themselves in black roll necks, tight Capri pants, and flatties [flat sandals] along with straight long hair and black-painted eyes a la Juliette Greco,” reported Professor Gundula Wolter (1994, 270).\\nSonja de Lennart was also the first designer who utilized the famous Everglaze textile from America which her family from California sent to de Lennart upon her request. Subsequently, it developed into big business for the American manufacturer. The material was then licensed to European companies; as a result, foreign royalties accounted for more than 70 percent of the firm’s total profits.\\nIn 1955 in Munich, Sonja de Lennart opened her new, much larger fashion house and renamed the company Maison Haase to include, in part, both her and her husband’s name. De Lennart’s fashion house became the place to be. Major movie companies, prominent opera directors, costume designers, and notables from all over the world traveled to Europe to acquire Sonja de Lennart’s design. Among those were Ingrid Bergman, Gary Cooper, Maria Schell, Curd Jürgens, and Klaus Kinski as well as nobles like the Countess of Stauffenberg; the Woolworth heir, Sunny von Bülow; Princess Auersperg and Queen Soraya Esfandiary, the wife of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, The 5th Dimension, and many others.\\nDe Lennart became one of the most innovative European fashion designers after World War II influencing a whole generation of new designers and was considered a leading pioneer of her time by major magazines wherein she was interviewed along with legendary fashion designers as Yves Saint Laurent, Paco Rabanne, and André Courrèges. There was almost no fashion designer who did not add Capri pants to their collection.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nExternal links\\nJuli 2003 / sw Abbildung: The Fifties (Fashionsourcebooks), Paperback Verlag http://www.wasistwas.de/sport-kultur/alle-artikel/artikel/link//462cb9e5d0/article/die-caprihose-modisches-highlight-der-50er-jahre.html\\nSonja de Lennart Official site\\nDer Grosse Brockhaus Lexikon/The Great Brockhaus (Bertelsmann Group) 2002-2007\\nLexikon.Meyers.de/wissen/Caprihose Click here: Meyers Lexikonverlag |Suchergebnis [search result] für »sonja de lennart«\\nJasmin Magazine, Number 12/69, 06/09/69, Interview, http://www.guj.de/\\nSonja de Lennart: Fashion Designer and Inventor of the famous Capri Pants Official site\\nAZ Abendzeitung, B1017A, 19 August 1955, \"A household name of international fashion design....For 20 years Sonja worked as fashion designer in inland and foreign countries\" http://abendzeitung.de\\nFreundin Magazine 8/69, 8 April 1969 3Z3875C, p. 44, 45, 46, 47 http://www.freundin.de/\\nEvening Paper Abendzeitung, AZ, B1017A, February 7/8, 1955 http://abendzeitung.de\\n- Mueller Science/University of Zuerich - Caprihosen [Capri Pants] (invented by Sonja de Lennart 1948) (German)\\nSZ Newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung, [206] 28 August 1959 ”Fashion Show---Eye Candy for Chubbies\" http://sueddeutsche.de\\nEvening Paper Abendzeitung, AZ, B1017A, 9 August 2010 \"A Life for the Capri-Pants\" (portrait)\\nBILD, 117/20, C8495A, 20 May 2011, p. 6, http://www.bild.de/ (portrait)\\nDer Spiegel, Zeitgeschehen online, 16 May 2011 \"Fashion Classics\" http://www.spiegel.de/\\nCosmopolitan, The Great Fashion Encyclopedia, \"C like Capri pants\" http://cosmopolitan.de\\nJasmin Magazine 26/69, 12/22/69 B8489, p. 29, http://www.guj.de/\\nEpoca Magazine, 11/1967\\nEvening Paper Abendzeitung, AZ, 16/17, August 1969, B1017A http://abendzeitung.de\\nJasmin Magazine 25/69, December 8, 1969 B8489D p. 181, 182 http://www.guj.de/\\nFreundin Magazine 17 December 1968, 26/68, 3Z3875D, p. 8 http://www.freundin.de/\\nMady Rahl http://www.imdb.com'), (1135, 'Lisa Lindahl is an American writer, artist, activist, and inventor. Lindahl is credited as one of the inventors of the first women\\'s general exercise bra, known as the jocksbra, along with theater costume designer Polly Smith, and Smimth\\'s assistant, Hinda Schreiber. Lindahl has been acknowledged for her many contributions to the Epilepsy Foundation, including teaching others about the cause, and raising money and awareness. She was born in Burlington, Vermont in 1948, and grew up in Montclair, New Jersey. She attended the University of Vermont for her undergraduate and received her bachelor\\'s degree in education in 1977, as well as also picking up secretarial classes at Katharine Gibbs School. Later in life Lindahl finished her master\\'s degree in culture and spirituality from Holy Names University in California in 2007. She currently resides in North Carolina.\\n\\nJocksbra\\nLindahl was in the middle of graduate school, which she put on hold, when she came up with the idea for the jocksbra.  Lindahl’s sister Victoria Woodrow called her up one day to complain about her painful experiences having to just wear a normal bra while working out. During the course of Lindahl and theater costume designer Polly Smith\\'s exploration for a better alternative, Lindahl\\'s husband suggested that what they needed was a jockstrap for women\\'s breasts. In the costume shop of Royall Tyler Theatre at the University of Vermont, Lindahl and Smith actually sewed two jockstraps together and nicknamed it a \"jockbra\". Smith\\'s assistant, Hinda Schreiber, also helped with creating the bra. It was later renamed a \"jogbra\". One of their original Jogbras is bronzed and on display near the costume shop of the theatre. Two others are housed by the Smithsonian and another by the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art.\\nFor years Lindahl held the role of president, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board for selling the invention. Then in 1990 Playtex purchased the invention. After Playtex\\'s purchasing of the company, Lindahl still served as Co-President of the Jogbra.\\n\\nEpilepsy\\nLisa Lindahl suffers from epilepsy herself, and has made it one of her main goals to educate others on the topic . Lindahl took upon the role of Senior Vice President of the Board of Directors of the Epilepsy Foundation for several years. While holding this position Lindahl created The Women and Epilepsy Health Initiative, which has given opportunities for researchers to study the gender differences in epilepsy.  For all her work to help the cause, the Epilepsy Foundation gave Lindahl a National Personal Achievement Award.  Lindahl was also awarded a Congressional Commendation for her work on epilepsy by Vermont Senator, Jeffords in 1999.\\n\\nCompression Comfort Bra\\nIn later years, Lindahl joined with Dr. Lesli Bell to create a form of her previous bra invention that would serve as a compression bra to help breast cancer patients overcome the pain and discomfort associated with procedures. With Lindahl’s prior knowledge of designing and entrepreneurship, in 2001 the two ladies invented the Compressoion Comfort Bra.  Along with the creation of the Compression Comfort Bra, Lindahl also worked to educate people about truncal lymphedema, which many women with breast cancer end up suffering from, and Dr. Bell has continued teaching the public about this issue, and is now a world renowned public speaker on the topic.\\n\\nOther contributions\\nLindahl has also put her education and practice to good use by teaching a Women’s Small Business Program at Trinity College in Burlington, Vermont.  She also co-authored the book used in her course, Minding Your Business.  Lindahl also taught business at Champlain College and Trinity College.  She later served as a Trustee of the Vermont Trust, which is an organization devoted to conserving Vermont’s landscape.   Lindahl as well participated in a support and backing network for entrepreneurs.  She was then nominated for the Boss of the Year Award, and Entrepreneur of the Year award, by the Sporting Goods Manufacturers’ Association, and by Inc. Magazine.\\n\\nPresent day\\nLisa Lindahl’s most recent publication is a book titled Beauty as Action, the Way of True Beauty and How its Practice can Change our World. A book about the present social archetype changes our society is going through. Lisa Lindahl now resides in South Carolina where she continues to practice art and writing.\\n\\n\\n== References =='), (1136, 'Barbara Liskov (born November 7, 1939 as Barbara Jane Huberman) is an American computer scientist who is an Institute Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Ford Professor of Engineering in its School of Engineering\\'s electrical engineering and computer science department.

Phillips (née Magie; 1866–1948) was an American game designer and Georgist. She invented The Landlord\\'s Game, the precursor to Monopoly, to illustrate teachings of the progressive era economist Henry George.\\n\\nLife and works\\nElizabeth J. Magie was born in Macomb, Illinois, in 1866 to James Magie, a newspaper publisher and an abolitionist who accompanied Lincoln as he traveled around Illinois in the late 1850s debating politics with Stephen Douglas. James Magie introduced Lizzie to the economist Henry George\\'s writing, specifically the book Progress and Poverty, after which Magie became a strong supporter of what at that time was called a single-tax system (Georgism). In the early 1880s she worked as a stenographer. She was also a short story and poetry writer, comedian, stage actress, feminist, and engineer. In 1906 she worked as a newspaper reporter. In 1910, at age 44, she married Albert Phillips.\\n\\nMagie first made the game, known as The Landlord\\'s Game, popular with friends while living in Brentwood, Maryland, and sought her first patent on it while living there. In 1903, Magie applied to the US Patent Office for a patent on her board game, which was designed to demonstrate the economic ill effects of land monopolism and the use of land value tax as a remedy for them. She was granted U.S. Patent 748,626 on January 5, 1904.\\nIn 1906, she moved to Chicago. That year, she and fellow Georgists formed the Economic Game Co. to self-publish her original edition of The Landlord\\'s Game. In 1910 she married Albert Phillips and Parker Brothers published her humorous card game Mock Trial. In 1912, The Landlord\\'s Game was adapted in Scotland by the Newbie Game Co. as Bre\\'r Fox and Bre\\'r Rabbit. Although the instructions claimed it was protected by a British patent, there is no evidence this was actually done.\\nShe and her husband moved back to the east coast of the U.S. and patented a revised version of the game in 1924; it received U.S. Patent 1,509,312. As her original patent had expired in 1921, this is seen as her attempt to reassert control over her game, which was now being played at some colleges, where students made their own copies. In 1932, her second edition of The Landlord\\'s Game was published by the Adgame Company of Washington D. C., probably another self-publishing effort. This version was two games in one, as there were alternate rules for a game called Prosperity.\\nAfter a January 1936 interview with her appeared in a Washington D. C. newspaper, in which she was somewhat critical of Parker Brothers, they agreed to publish two more of her games.\\nThey sold her final board game inventions Bargain Day and King\\'s Men in 1937, and a third version of The Landlord\\'s Game in 1939. In Bargain Day, shoppers compete with each other in a department store; King\\'s Men is an abstract strategy game. Few copies of the Parker Brothers version of The Landlord\\'s Game are known to exist, but Bargain Day and King\\'s Men are less rare.\\n\\nDeath and legacy\\nMagie died in Staunton, Virginia in 1948, aged 82. She is buried with her husband, Albert Wallace Phillips, in Columbia Gardens Cemetery, located in Arlington, Virginia.\\nHer role as the board game Monopoly\\'s inventor was not uncovered during her lifetime, but rather during research for a trial. Ralph Anspach was an economics professor, and in 1973 he began a long legal battle against Parker Brothers over his Anti-Monopoly game. While researching the case, he uncovered her patents. His research became part of the court record.\\n\\nReferences\\nFurther reading\\nWalsh, Tim (2004). The Playmakers: Amazing Origins of Timeless Toys. Keys Publishing.

In 1996 she was inducted into the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame for her development of the Silicon Eye and other computational systems. She died by suicide at age 33.\\n\\nEarly life and education\\nMahowald, known as Misha, was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, daughter of Alfred and Joan Fischer Mahowald. She had a younger sister, Sheila.\\nAfter graduating high school, she attended the California Institute of Technology, graduating with a degree in biology in 1985. She continued at Caltech as a PhD student in Computation and Neural Systems under the supervision of Professor Carver Mead, a specialist in computer science. For her thesis, Mahowald created her own project by combining the fields of biology, computer science, and electrical engineering, to produce the silicon retina.\\n\\nCareer\\nThe silicon retina used analog electrical circuits to mimic the biological functions of rod cells, cone cells, and other non-photoreceptive cells in the retina of the eye. The invention was not only highly original and potentially useful as a device for restoring sight to the blind, but it was also one of the most eclectic feats of electrical and biological engineering of the time. This remarkable example of engineering earned Mahowald a well-deserved reputation as one of the most famous female engineers of her age. Her work has been considered \"the best attempt to date\" to develop a stereoscopic vision system. She was awarded a doctorate in computational neuroscience in 1992, and her invention of the silicon retina and the silicon neuron earned her articles in the prestigious scientific journals Scientific American and Nature, as well as four patents and the Clauser Prize for her dissertation. A revised version of her dissertation [2] was subsequently published in book form.\\nMahowald then re-located to the University of Oxford for one year to do a post-doctoral fellowship with eminent neuroscientists Kevan Martin and Rodney Douglas. After the completion of this project, Mahowald moved to Zürich to help found the Institute of Neuroinformatics (Institut für Neuroinformatik) at the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich, a research institution whose mission is to discover the key principles by which brains work and to implement these in artificial systems that interact intelligently with the real world.\\nIn 1996, she was made a member of the Women in Technology International (WITI) Hall of Fame.\\nMahowald died in Zürich at the end of 1996, taking her own life at the age of 33.\\nAspects of her work and personal life have been described in a book about the creation of the vision sensor company Foveon.\\nThe Misha Mahowald Prize for Neuromorphic Engineering was created to recognize outstanding achievements in the field of neuromorphic engineering.

In the first three decades of the 20th century, she founded and developed a large and prominent commercial and educational enterprise centered on cosmetics for African-American women.\\n\\nBiography\\nAnnie Minerva Turnbo was born in southern Illinois, the daughter of enslaved Africans Robert and Isabella (Cook) Turnbo. When her father went off to fight for the Union with the 1st Kentucky Cavalry in the Civil War, Isabella took the couple\\'s children and escaped from Kentucky, a neutral border state that maintained slavery. After traveling down the Ohio River, she found refuge in Metropolis, Illinois. There Annie Turnbo was later born, the tenth of eleven children.\\nAnnie Turnbo was born on a farm near Metropolis in Massac County, Illinois. Orphaned at a young age, she attended a public school in Metropolis, before moving in 1896 to live with her older sister Ada Moody in Peoria. There Annie attended high school, taking particular interest in chemistry. However, due to frequent illness, Annie was forced to withdraw from classes.\\nWhile out of school, Annie grew so fascinated with hair and hair care that she often practiced hairdressing with her sister. With expertise in both chemistry and hair care, Turnbo began to develop her own hair-care products. At the time, many women used goose fat, heavy oils, soap, or bacon grease to straighten their curls, which damaged both scalp and hair.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nBy the beginning of the 1900s, Turnbo moved with her older siblings to Lovejoy, now known as Brooklyn, Illinois. While experimenting with hair and different hair-care products, she developed and manufactured her own line of non-damaging hair straighteners, special oils, and hair-stimulant products for African-American women. She named her new product “Wonderful Hair Grower” To promote her new product, Turnbo sold the Wonderful Hair Grower in bottles from door-to-door. Her products and sales began to revolutionize hair-care methods for all African Americans.\\nIn 1902, Turnbo moved to a thriving St. Louis, where she and three hired assistants sold her hair-care products from door-to-door. As part of her marketing, she gave away free treatments to attract more customers.\\nIn 1902 she married Nelson Pope; the couple divorced in 1907.\\n\\nOn April 28, 1914, Annie Turnbo married Aaron Eugene Malone, a former teacher and religious book salesman. Turnbo Malone, by then worth well over a million dollars, built a five-story multipurpose facility.\\n\\nCareer\\nDue to the high demand for her product in St. Louis, Turnbo opened her first shop on 2223 Market Street in 1902. She also launched a wide advertising campaign in the black press, held news conferences, toured many southern states, and recruited many women whom she trained to sell her products.\\nOne of her selling agents, Sarah Breedlove Davis (who became known as Madam C. J. Walker when she set up her own business), operated in Denver, Colorado until a disagreement led Walker to leave the company. This development was one of the reasons which led then Mrs. Pope to copyright her products under the name \"Poro\" because of what she called fraudulent imitations and to discourage counterfeit versions. Poro was a combination of the married names of Annie Pope and her sister Laura Roberts. Due to the growth in her business, in 1910 Turnbo moved to a larger facility on 3100 Pine Street.\\nIn addition to a manufacturing plant, it contained facilities for a beauty college, which she named Poro College. The building included a manufacturing plant, a retail store where Poro products were sold, business offices, a 500-seat auditorium, dining and meeting rooms, a roof garden, dormitory, gymnasium, bakery, and chapel. It served the African-American community as a center for religious and social functions.\\nThe College\\'s curriculum addressed the whole student; students were coached on personal style for work: on walking, talking, and a style of dress designed to maintain a solid persona. Poro College employed nearly 200 people in St. Louis. Through its school and franchise businesses, the college created jobs for almost 75,000 women in North and South America, Africa and the Philippines.\\nBy the 1920s, Annie Turnbo Malone had become a multi-millionaire. In 1924 she paid income tax of nearly $40,000, reportedly the highest in Missouri. While extremely wealthy, Malone lived modestly, giving thousands of dollars to the local black YMCA and the Howard University College of Medicine in Washington, DC. She also donated money to the St. Louis Colored Orphans Home, where she served as president on the board of directors from 1919 to 1943. With her help, in 1922 the Home bought a facility at 2612 Goode Avenue (which was renamed Annie Malone Drive in her honor).\\n\\nThe Orphans Home is still located in the historic Ville neighborhood. Upgraded and expanded, the facility was renamed in the entrepreneur\\'s honor as the Annie Malone Children and Family Service Center. As well as funding many programs, Malone ensured that her employees, all African American, were paid well and given opportunities for advancement.\\nHer business thrived until 1927, when her husband filed for divorce. Having served as president of the company, he demanded half of the business\\' value, based on his claim that his contributions had been integral to its success. The divorce suit forced Poro College into a court-ordered receivership. With support from her employees and powerful figures such as Mary McLeod Bethune, she negotiated a settlement of $200,000. This affirmed her as the sole owner of Poro College, and the divorce was granted.\\nAfter the divorce, Turnbo Malone moved most of her business to Chicago’s South Parkway, where she bought an entire city block. Other lawsuits followed. In 1937, during the Great Depression, a former employee filed suit, also claiming credit for Poro\\'s success. To raise money for the settlement, Turnbo Malone sold her St. Louis property. Although much reduced in size, her business continued to thrive.\\n\\nDeath and legacy\\nMalone was named an honorary member of the Zeta Phi Beta sorority and was awarded an honorary degree from Howard University.\\nOn May 10, 1957, Annie Malone suffered a stroke and died at Chicago\\'s Provident Hospital. Childless, she had bequeathed her business and remaining fortune to her nieces and nephews.  At the time of her death, her estate was valued at $100,000.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\n\"Annie Malone\", Living St. Louis Story, KETC-9.\\nAnnie Malone Children & Family Service Center\\n\"Annie Malone photographs\". University of Missouri–St. Louis.'), (1141, 'Joy Mangano (; born February 1, 1956) is an American inventor and entrepreneur known for inventions such as the self-wringing Miracle Mop. She is the president of Ingenious Designs, LLC, and appears regularly on the US television shopping channel HSN.\\nMangano released her autobiography, Inventing Joy, in 2017. The 2015 film Joy was loosely based on her life. Jennifer Lawrence was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Mangano.\\n\\nEarly life\\nMangano was born in 1956, in East Meadow, New York, to Italian-American parents. Mangano began inventing at an early age when, as a teenager working at an animal hospital in Huntington, New York, on Long Island, she dreamed up a fluorescent flea collar to keep pets safe. A product with a similar design was released the next year by Hartz Mountain. After graduating from Pace University with a degree in business administration in 1978, she held a variety of jobs, including waitress and airline reservations manager while raising her three children as a divorced mother.\\n\\nInventions\\nMangano holds more than 100 patents for her inventions. \"I think my products have been successful because they have mass appeal,\" she has said. \"I\\'m just like everybody else out there. I\\'m a mom, I work, I have a house to clean, things to organize. We all have similar needs, and I address them.\"\\n\\nMiracle Mop\\nIn 1990 after growing frustrated with ordinary mops, Mangano developed her first invention, the Miracle Mop, a self-wringing plastic mop with a head made from a continuous loop of 300 feet (90 meters) of cotton that can be easily wrung out without getting the user\\'s hands wet. With her own savings and investments from family and friends, she made a prototype and manufactured 100 units. Early assembly was done in her father\\'s body shop in Peconic in 1991.\\nAfter selling the mop at trade shows and in local stores on Long Island, she sold 1,000 units on consignment to QVC. It sold modestly at first, but once QVC allowed Mangano to go on-air to sell it herself, she sold 18,000 mops in less than a half hour. Mangano incorporated her business as Arma Products, later renaming it Ingenious Designs. She sold Ingenious Designs to USA Networks, the parent company of the Home Shopping Network, in 1999. By the year 2000, her company was selling $10 million worth of Miracle Mops per year.\\n\\nOther products\\nHuggable Hangers – velvet-flocked, no-slip hangers whose thin profile conserves closet space. Endorsed by Oprah Winfrey, Huggable Hangers were HSN\\'s best-selling product as of 2010, with more than 300 million sold.\\nForever Fragrant – a line of home odor neutralizers including sticks, wickless candles, scent stands, finials, spheres, drawer liners, and shoe shapers. Mangano broke an HSN record on January 31, 2010 by selling 180,000 units in one day. The Forever Fragrant line has won the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval.\\nClothes It All Luggage System – wheeled luggage with organizational features like a padded laptop compartment, a toiletry organizer, a pocket for plane tickets, and removable dividers. They range from smaller duffel bags to a 22-inch (56-centimeter) portable dresser with removable drawers, as well as a briefcase and pet carrier.\\nPerformance Platforms – shoes with a rubber platform heel that gives the wearer extra height. In May 2010, Mangano sold 30,000 pairs in three hours on HSN. The line began as sneakers, and has since branched to Mary Janes, mules, and sandals. The shoes are produced in conjunction with the Grasshoppers division of the Stride Rite Corporation.\\nComfort & Joy Textiles – bedding made from Supima cotton and down alternative with a reversible, zippered duvet cover and sheets that are attached to the bed skirt for removal and cleaning.\\nShades Readers – a line of reading glasses sold in sets of three or more so that they can be kept around the home and office for easy access. Mangano has sold more than a million pairs.\\n\\nOn-air presence, partnerships\\nTelevision\\nSoon after she began appearing on QVC in 1992, Mangano began spending 120 hours a year on air. She now appears regularly on HSN, and is considered to be HSN\\'s most successful purveyor, with annual sales of more than $150 million. Her hourly sales regularly top $1 million. Mangano has also appeared in shorter commercials and infomercials for her company\\'s products. She said that while selling on television is an opportunity to reach millions of people, it requires genuine enthusiasm to persuade people who can\\'t touch or try the product. A HSN executive wrote that Mangano\\'s success is due to her ability to convey her \"passion, excitement and pride of every detail with her viewers.\"\\n\\nOther TV appearances\\nIn 2005, Mangano was a judge on the cable reality show Made in the USA. She also appeared on the ABC show The View on February 2, 2007.\\n\\nProduct partnerships\\nMangano has partnered with celebrities and other television personalities to bring their products to HSN. They include tennis star Serena Williams\\' line of jewelry, Frank Sepe fitness products, fashions from supermodel Iman, products from Rosie O\\'Donnell, Esteban guitars, and Who Knew? books by Bruce Lubin. She also partnered with chef Todd English to create GreenPan cookware, which uses a ceramic-based non-stick coating that the press release describes as: \"PTFE-free, and uses no PFOA in manufacturing, making GreenPan cookware \\'green\\' in manufacturing\". Mangano and English debuted GreenPans on HSN on July 26, 2007, and sold 24,000 pieces in 4 hours.\\n\\nAwards and distinctions\\nIn 1997, Mangano was named Long Island Entrepreneur of the Year by Ernst & Young. In 2009, she was ranked number 77 on Fast Company\\'s list of The 100 Most Creative People in Business; and in 2010, she was listed in their list of The 10 Most Creative Women in Business.\\n\\nIn popular culture\\nA character based on Mangano is portrayed by Jennifer Lawrence in the 2015 film Joy, directed by David O. Russell, with Mangano credited as executive producer. It was released on Christmas Day 2015.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nMangano married Tony Miranne in 1978 shortly after both graduated from Pace University. They divorced in 1989. They have three children: Christie, Robert, and Jacqueline Miranne.\\n\\nSee also\\nList of inventors\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\n\\nOfficial website\\nJoy Mangano on Facebook\\nJoy Mangano on IMDb'), (1142, 'Elizabeth Holloway Marston (February 20, 1893 – March 27, 1993) was an American attorney and psychologist. She is credited, with her husband William Moulton Marston, for the development of the systolic blood pressure measurement used to detect deception.\\nShe is also credited as the inspiration for her husband\\'s comic book creation Wonder Woman, a character also fashioned on their polyamorous life partner, Olive Byrne.\\n\\nEarly life\\nMarston was born Sadie Holloway in the Isle of Man and raised in Boston, Massachusetts. She was the daughter of an English mother, Daisy, and William George Washington Holloway, an American bank clerk. She received her BA in psychology from Mount Holyoke College in 1915 and her LLB from the Boston University School of Law in 1918, where she was \"one of three women to graduate from the School of Law that year.\"\\n\\nSystolic blood-pressure test\\nBoth William and Marston joined the psychology department at Harvard, with William in the doctoral program and Marston in the master\\'s program at Radcliffe College. She worked with William on his thesis, which concerned the correlation between blood pressure levels and deception. He later developed this into the systolic blood-pressure test used to detect deception that was the predecessor to the polygraph test.\\nIn 1921, William received his PhD from Harvard and Marston her MA from Radcliffe. Although Marston is not listed as William\\'s collaborator in his early work, a number of writers refer directly and indirectly to Elizabeth\\'s work on her husband\\'s deception research. She appears in a picture taken in his polygraph laboratory in the 1920s, reproduced in a 1938 publication by William.\\n\\nCareer and family\\nMarston\\'s career included indexing \"the documents of the first fourteen Congresses, lectured on law, ethics, and psychology at American and New York Universities, [and] served as an editor for Encyclopædia Britannica and McCall\\'s. In 1933, she became the assistant to the chief executive at Metropolitan Life Insurance.\\nWilliam had children with both Marston and their partner, Olive Byrne (Marston eventually legally adopted Byrne\\'s children). While Olive stayed home to raise the children, Marston supported the family when William was out of work, as well as after his death in 1947. Both Olive and Marston \"embodied the feminism of the day.\"\\n\\nWonder Woman\\nIn 1992, The New York Times discussed Marston\\'s involvement in the creation of Wonder Woman:\\n\\nOur Towns reveals the true identity of Wonder Woman\\'s real Mom.

She won numerous prizes for her sporting achievements including those of swimming, cycling, mountain climbing, winter sports, ballooning, flying, riding, gymnastics, athletics, rifle shooting and fencing. She was the first woman to climb many of the peaks in the French and Swiss Alps. She was a record-breaking balloonist, an aviator and during World War I became the first woman to fly missions during conflict as a pilot. She was also a qualified surgical nurse, was the first trained and certified Flight Nurse in the world, and worked for the establishment of air ambulance services throughout the world. According to a French source, it was M. de Château-Thierry de Beaumanoir who, in 1903, named Marie Marvingt as \"La fiancée du danger.\" She herself used the epithet for an autobiographical publication in 1948. It is also included on the commemorative plaque on the façade of the house where she lived at 8 Place de la Carrière, Nancy.\\n\\nBiography\\nEarly life\\nMarie Marvingt was born at 6.30 p.m of 20 February 1875 in Aurillac, the Chief Town of the Cantal département of France. Her father\\'s full name was Félix Constant Marvingt and her mother was named Elisabeth Brusquin. They had married in Metz, Moselle, Lorraine on 16 July 1861. At the date of birth they were recorded as 48 and 32, respectively. Her father was \"Receveur principal des Postes\" – roughly equivalent to Senior Postmaster. The full names of the subject, as recorded on the certificate, are:- Marie Félicie Elisabeth Marvingt.\\nLater, her family moved to Metz, at that time part of Germany, where they lived from 1880 to 1889. When Marie Marvingt\\'s mother died in 1889, the girl found herself, at 14, in charge of a household of her father and her brother, whom she cared for while devouring books by explorers and scientists. After her mother\\'s death, she moved with her father and brother to Nancy in the Meurthe-et-Moselle département, where she remained for the rest of her life.\\nShe was encouraged to participate in sports by her father, Felix. It is said that at the age of 5 she had already swum 4000m in a single day. She enjoyed many other sports including water polo, horse riding, athletics, boxing, martial arts, fencing, shooting, tennis, golf, hockey, football, winter sports, and mountaineering, and also practiced circus skills. In 1890, at the age of 15, she canoed over 400 kilometers from Nancy to Koblenz, Germany. In 1899 she earned her driving licence.\\n\\nSporting successes\\nMarvingt became a world-class athlete who won numerous prizes in swimming, fencing, shooting, ski jumping, speed skating, luge and bobsledding. She was also a skilled mountaineer and between 1903 and 1910 she became the first woman to climb most of the peaks in the French and Swiss Alps – including traversing the Aiguille des Grands Charmoz and the Grépon Pass from Chamonix in a single day, with the guides of the Payot family of Chamonix. In 1905 during a race she became the first Frenchwoman to swim the length of the Seine through Paris. The newspapers nicknamed her \"l\\'amphibie rouge\" (\"the red amphibian\") from the colour of her swimming costume.\\nIn 1907 she won an international military shooting competition using a French army carbine and became the only woman ever awarded the palms du Premier Tireur (First Gunner palms) by a French Minister of War. She dominated the 1908 to 1910 winter sports seasons at Chamonix, Gérardmer, and Ballon d\\'Alsace, where she achieved first place on more than 20 occasions. On 26 January 1910 she won the Coupe Leon Auscher (Leon Auscher Cup) in the women\\'s bobsledding world championship.\\nShe enjoyed cycling and rode from Nancy, France, to Naples, Italy, to see a volcanic eruption. In 1908 she was refused permission to participate in the Tour de France because the race was only open to men. Marvingt refused to relinquish her ambition and cycled the course after the race. She successfully completed the gruelling ride, a feat which only 36 of 114 male riders had managed that year. On 15 March 1910 the Académie des Sports (French Academy of Sports) awarded her a Médaille d\\'Or (Gold Medal) \"for all sports\", the only multi-sport medal they have ever awarded.\\n\\nAchievements in early aviation\\nBallooning\\nMarie Marvingt ascended as a passenger in a free-flight balloon for the first time in 1901. Then, on 19 July 1907, she piloted one. In September 1909, she made her first solo flight as a balloon pilot. On 26 October 1909 Marvingt became the first woman to pilot a balloon across the North Sea and English Channel from Europe to England. For this flight, her balloon was called L\\'Étoile Filante (The Shooting Star). She won prizes for ballooning in 1909 and 1910. She earned her balloon pilot\\'s certificate (#145) from the Aero-Club Stella in 1910.\\n\\nFixed-wing powered flight\\nIn September 1909, Marie Marvingt experienced her first flight as a passenger in an aeroplane piloted by Roger Sommer. During 1910, she studied fixed-wing aviation with Hubert Latham, the Anglo-French rival of Louis Blériot, in an Antoinette aeroplane. She piloted and flew solo in this monoplane, the first woman to do so – she was the second to be licensed in a monoplane, the first being Marthe Niel.\\nMarie Marvingt received a pilot\\'s licence from the Aéro-Club de France (Aero Club of France) on 8 November 1910 Licensed No. 281, she was the third Frenchwoman to be registered after Raymonde de Laroche (No. 36) and Marthe Niel (No. 226). She was the only woman ever licensed in the difficult-to-fly Antoinette monoplane. In her first 900 flights she never \"broke wood\" in a crash, a record unequaled at that time.\\n\\nFemina Cup\\nOnce licensed, Marie Marvingt competed on a number of occasions for the Coupe Femina (Femina Cup). On 3 December 1910, the Illustrated London News featured Marie Marvingt on its \"Portraits and World\\'s News\" page. A head-and-shoulders portrait is carried in a circular frame at the top of the page. She wears her leather flying helmet, with goggles pushed up. A fulsome report below states that she has beaten the long distance flight record for airwomen. \"The flight was made for a cup offered by the Paris newspaper Femina.\" She had beaten \"Madame Laroche\\'s record\", with a flight of 27 miles in 53 minutes, piloting an Antoinette. This took place at Mourmelon-le-grand, where she was a pupil of Latham. It was probably believed that this would lead to her Femina Cup success for 1910, but this was not to be so. Incidentally, this citation also confirms her swimming prowess, including the Seine swim, as well as her mountaineering feats. Finally, on 21 December 1910, she was beaten in that year\\'s Femina Cup contest by Hélène Dutrieu, who won again in both 1911 and 1912. Actually, Marie Marvingt was never to grasp this trophy, since it was won by de Laroche in 1913, and then discontinued because of the war. Although the annual award results for this trophy are somewhat unclear, due to journalistic enthusiasm at the time, with a tendency to report \"wins\" before the year-end, these facts have now emerged and each year\\'s result will be fully supported by contemporary citations.\\n\\nAir displays\\nIt is said that Marie Marvingt was again competing for the Coup Femina in Turin in 1911. A leader of aviation in Turin was the Sicilian-born engineer Prof. Franz Miller, who in 1909 founded the first Italian \"Factory for the Production of Flying Machines\" at No. 9, Via Legnano, Turin. During 1911, there were many competitions on the Italian international air circuit at Montichiari (Brescia) and flying schools were started both by Miller\\'s company and by the Asteria Company who advertised the availability of \"both biplanes and monoplanes\" with \"instructors of the highest order\". However, as indicated above some reports that \"she won the Coup Femina in Turin\" are incorrect.\\n\\nDelay in air ambulance plans\\nMarie Marvingt proposed the development of fixed-wing aircraft as air ambulances to the French government as early as 1910. With the help of Deperdussin company engineer Becherau (who also designed the SPAD fighter), she designed the first practical air ambulance. She carried out a campaign to raise money to purchase one for the French Government and the Red Cross, and in 1912 she ordered an air ambulance from Deperdussin, but it was never delivered because the business failed after the owner, Armand Deperdussin, embezzled company money At trial, with the verdict announced on 30 March 1917, Deperdussin was found guilty of fraud and sentenced to five years’ hard labour. He was by then already bankrupt. But by application of the law of \"Sursis\", he was granted an indefinite postponement of sentence. He later committed suicide through shame.\\n\\nWorld War I and the French armed forces\\nIn 1914 Marvingt was drawn by Émile Friant with her proposed air ambulance. During World War I she disguised herself as a man and, with the connivance of a French infantry lieutenant, served on the front lines as a Chasseur 2ième Classe (Soldier, 2nd Class) in the 42ième Bataillon de Chasseurs à Pied (42nd Battalion of Foot Soldiers). She was discovered and sent home but later participated in military operations with the Italian 3º Reggimento Alpini (3rd Regiment of Alpine Troops) in the Italian Dolomites at the direct request of Marshal Foch. She also served as a Red Cross nurse.\\nIn 1915 Marvingt became the first woman in the world to fly combat missions when she became a volunteer pilot flying bombing missions over German-held territory and she received the Croix de guerre (Military Cross) for her aerial bombing of a German military base in Metz. Between the two World Wars she worked as a journalist, war correspondent, and medical officer with French Forces in North Africa. While in Morocco she invented metal skis and suggested their use on aeroplanes landing on sand.\\n\\nAir ambulances\\nMarvingt devoted the remainder of her long life to the concept of aeromedical evacuation, giving more than 3000 conferences and seminars on the subject on at least four continents. She was co-founder of the French organisation Les Amies De L\\'Aviation Sanitaire (Friends of Medical Aviation) and was also one of the organizers behind the success of the First International Congress on Medical Aviation in 1929.\\nIn 1931 she created the Challenge Capitaine-Écheman (Captain Écheman Challenge) which gave a prize for the best civil aircraft which was transformable to an air ambulance. In 1934 she established a civil air ambulance service in Morocco and was subsequently awarded the Medaille de la Paix du Maroc (Medal of Peace of Morocco). In the same year she developed training courses for the Infirmières de l\\'Air (Nurses of the Air) and in 1935 became the first person certified as a Flight Nurse. In 1934 and 1935 she wrote, directed and appeared in two documentary films about the history, development and use of air ambulances: Les Ailes qui Sauvent (Wings which Save) and Sauvés par la Colombe (Saved by the Dove). On 24 January 1935 Marvingt was made a Chevalier de la Légion d\\'honneur (Knight of the Legion of Honour), and was promoted to the grade of Officer in 1949.\\nThe Flying Ambulance Corps operated by women pilots and staffed by doctors and trained nurses, was intended to rescue the wounded on the battlefield using aircraft, landing at designated ground stations with crews of nurses, stretcher-bearers, and effective medical aid. By 1939, it appeared vital again and Marie Marvingt had been working on this and similar schemes for nearly thirty years. Whilst organising \"L\\'Aviation Sanitaire\", recruiting women pilots and nurses, she made several visits to America to confer with Government officials in that country. In France itself, she had been supported by authorities including Marshals Foch and Joffre. Her schemes caught the imagination of the young women of her country and at the start of WW II, this escalated. More than five hundred nurses with at least ten hours\\' flying experience joined a new parachute corps, directly initiated by another famous French flier, Maryse Hilsz,. Dressed in full nursing uniform and carrying supplies, Hilz and others made parachute landings on occasions when weather or ground conditions made it impossible for flying ambulances to land. With the fall of France, Hilz joined the resistance and briefly, just after the war, was involved in setting up a women pilots’ corps in the regular French Air Force (Armée de l\\'air). During World War II Marie Marvingt also established a convalescent centre for wounded aviators and served as a surgical nurse, inventing a new type of surgical suture. On 30 January 1955, she received the Deutsch de la Meurthe grand prize from the Fédération Nationale d\\'Aéronautique (French National Federation of Aeronautics) at the Sorbonne for her work in aviation medicine.\\n\\nAn octogenarian aviator\\nOn 20 February 1955, her eightieth birthday, Marvingt was flown over Nancy by a U.S. Air Force officer from Toul-Rosières Air Base in an American fighter jet. In the same year she also studied piloting helicopters, though she never earned her helicopter pilot\\'s licence. In 1961, at the age of 86, she cycled from Nancy to Paris.\\n\\nDeath and posthumous recognition\\nMarie Marvingt died on 14 December 1963, aged 88, at Laxou, a small commune in the Meurthe-et-Moselle department in north-eastern France. Her funeral was on 17 December in Saint-Epvre and she is buried in the Cimetière de Préville, Nancy, department, Lorraine, France. \\nIn France, there are streets, gymnasia, schools, flying clubs, scout groups, and an apartment complex named after her. France issued an air mail stamp in her honour on 29 June 2004. Several annual awards are given in her memory including those of the Soroptimist Club of Aurillac, France, and one sponsored by the French Aviation and Space Medicine Association (SOFRAMAS) through the United States Aerospace Medical Association.\\n\\nPhilately\\nIn 2004, Marie Marvingt was commemorated by a French Airmail stamp bearing the face value of €5.00.\\nDesigned by Christophe Drochon and engraved by André Lavergne.\\nDate of issue 05-07-2004 – Withdrawal date 05-08-2005.\\nHorizontal format, 47 x 27 mm; perforations included 52 x 31 mm.\\nTwo bars phosphorescent.\\nPrint Mixed – Intaglio / offset; colour polychrome.\\nPerforations 13 x 13 1/2\\nIssued in a souvenir sheet of ten.\\nMichel Catalogue No. 3832.\\n\\nWorks\\nPublished works\\nNon-fiction\\nLa Fiancée du Danger (Fiancee of Danger) (No copy of this reported publication has been found—if anyone can find it, a detailed citation and location would be appreciated.)\\nMa Traversée de la Mer du Nord en Ballon (My North Sea Crossing in a Balloon)\\nLes Ailes qui Sauvent (Wings which Save), 1949 (Listed in many works on Marvingt, no copy of this publication has been found—If anyone can find it, a detailed citation and location would be appreciated.)\\nSauvés par la Colombe (Saved by the Dove), 1950 (Listed in many works on Marvingt, no copy of this publication has been found—If anyone can find it, a detailed citation and location would be appreciated.)\\nMarvingt also published many articles and papers.\\n\\nFiction and poetry\\nMarvingt wrote fiction and prize-winning poetry under the pseudonym Myriel.\\n\\nFilms\\nLes Ailes qui Sauvent (The Wings which Save), 1934, writer, director and actor/presenter (This film still exists.)\\nSauvés par la Colombe (Saved by the Dove), 1935, writer, director and actor/presenter (This film seems to have disappeared entirely, and no copy has been found in spite of much effort.)\\n\\nAwards\\nMarvingt received the greatest range of decorations amongst women in the history of France with more than 34 official medals and decorations.\\nAwarded the Palmes Académiques (Academic Palms).\\nAwarded the Médaille de l\\'Aéronautique (Medal for Aeronautics).\\n1907, awarded the palms du Premier Tireur (First Gunner palms) by the Minister of War.\\n26 January 1910, won the Coupe Leon Auscher (Leon Auscher Cup) in the women\\'s bobsledding world championship.\\n15 March 1910, awarded a Médaille d\\'Or (Gold Medal) \"for all sports\" from the Académie des Sports (Academy of Sports).\\n1911, competed in the Aéro-Club de France\\'s (Aero Club of France) Coupe Femina (Femina Cup) for long-distance flying.\\nAwarded the Croix de guerre 1914 -1918 avec palmes (Military Cross 1914–1918 with palms) for her aerial bombing of a German military base.\\nAwarded the Médaille de la Paix du Maroc (Medal of Peace of Morocco) for establishing a civil air ambulance service.\\nA Full Member of \"Les Vieilles Tiges\", an aero-club for pilots, pioneers and friends of aviation, founded on 20 November 1920.

On the basis of Zosimos\\'s comments, she lived between the first and third centuries A.D. French, Taylor and Lippmann list her as one of the first alchemical writers, dating her works at no later than the first century. \\nShe is credited with the invention of several kinds of chemical apparatus and is considered to be the first true alchemist of the Western world.\\n\\nHistory\\nThe primary source for the existence of \"Mary the Jewess\" within the context of alchemy is Zosimos of Panopolis, who wrote, in the 4th century, the oldest extant books on alchemy. Zosimos described several of Mary\\'s experiments and instruments. In his writings, Mary is almost always mentioned as having lived in the past, and she is described as \"one of the sages.\"\\nGeorge Syncellus, a Byzantine chronicler of the 8th century, presented Mary as a teacher of Democritus, whom she had met in Memphis, Egypt, during the time of Pericles.\\nThe 10th century Kitāb al-Fihrist of Ibn al-Nadim cited Mary as one of the 52 most famous alchemists and stated that she was able to prepare caput mortuum, a purple pigment.\\nThe early medieval alchemical text ascribed to an otherwise unknown \"Morienus Romanus\" called her \"Mary the Prophetess,\" and the Arabs knew her as the \"Daughter of Plato\" — a name which, in Western alchemical texts, was reserved for white sulfur.\\n\\nWritings\\nAlthough none of Mary\\'s writings have survived, some quotations credited to her are found in hermetic writings. The most notable of these are found in The Dialogue of Mary and Aros on the Magistery of Hermes, which is an extract made by an anonymous Christian philosopher. Operations are described in this document which would later become the basis of alchemy, such as leukosis (whitening) and xanthosis (yellowing). The document describes, for the first time, an acid salt and other acids. There are also several recipes for making gold from plants (mandragora, for example).\\nSeveral cryptic alchemical precepts have been attributed to Mary. She is said to have spoken of the union of opposites:\\n\\nJoin the male and the female, and you will find what is sought.\\n\\nThe following was known as the Axiom of Maria:\\n\\nOne becomes two, two becomes three, and out of the third comes the one as the fourth.\\n\\nMarie-Louise von Franz, an associate of psychologist Carl Jung, gives an alternative version:\\n\\nOut of the One comes Two, out of Two comes Three, and from the Third comes the One as the Fourth.\\n\\nCarl Jung used this axiom as a metaphor for wholeness and individuation.\\n\\nInventions\\nMary is said to have discovered hydrochloric acid, though this is not accepted by most science texts.\\nMary, along with Agathodaemon, Pseudo-Democritus, and Hermes Trismegistus, was mentioned by Zosimos of Panopolis in his descriptions of certain devices, such as the tribikos, the kerotakis, and the bain-marie. But her contributions are disputed and not clear.\\n\\nTribikos\\nThe tribikos (Greek: τριβικός) was a kind of alembic with three arms that was used to obtain substances purified by distillation. It is not known whether Mary invented it, but Zosimos credits the first description of the instrument to her. It is still used today in alchemy and chemistry labs. In her writings (quoted by Zosimos), she recommends that the copper or bronze used to make the tubes should be the thickness of a frying pan and that the joints between the tubes and the still-head should be sealed with flour paste.\\n\\nKerotakis\\nThe kerotakis (Greek: κηροτακίς or κυροτακίς), is a device used to heat substances used in alchemy and to collect vapors. It is an airtight container with a sheet of copper upon its upper side. When working properly, all its joints form a tight vacuum. The use of such sealed containers in the hermetic arts led to the term \"hermetically sealed.\" The kerotakis was said to be a replication of the process of the formation of gold that was occurring in the bowels of the earth.\\nThis instrument was later modified by the German chemist Franz von Soxhlet in 1879 to create the extractor that bears his name, the Soxhlet extractor.\\n\\nBain-marie\\nMary\\'s name survives in her invention of the bain-marie (Mary\\'s Bath), which limits the maximum temperature of a container and its contents to the boiling point of a separate liquid: essentially a double boiler. It is extensively used in chemical processes for which a gentle heat is necessary. This term was introduced by Arnold of Villanova in the 14th century. The bain-marie is also used for cooking food.\\n\\nSee also\\nAlchemy\\nCleopatra the Alchemist (Egypt)\\n\\nReferences\\nBibliography\\nPatai, Raphael (1995). The Jewish Alchemists.

Masters was the first person residing in the American colonies to be given an English patent, and possibly the first known Caucasian machinery inventor of her sex in America. Masters was given a patent for a corn mill in 1715 in her husband\\'s name, as women were not allowed to have their own patents. She also patented a process for making hats.\\nNot much is known of Masters\\' early life. It is possible that she was born in Bermuda as her father had emigrated from there in 1687.\\n\\nEarly life\\nIt is believed that she was born around 1676 and in 1687 she and her six sisters emigrated from Bermuda to Burlington Township, New Jersey (along the Delaware River) with her Quaker parents Sarah and William Righton. Sybilla Righton first showed up in the colonial records in 1692 when she testified as a witness for her father in the New Jersey courts. Sometime between 1693 and 1696 Sybilla married Thomas Masters a prosperous Quaker merchant and landowner. They had four children Mary, Sarah, Thomas and William.\\n\\nJourney to London\\nOn June 24, 1712 Masters left her family and headed to London to pursue patents for her invention ideas. In 1712, some American colonies were issuing patents, but Pennsylvania was not among them. On November 25, 1715 the patent was granted by King George I of Great Britain in her husband\\'s name for the process of \"Cleaning and Curing The Indian Corn Growing in the several Colonies of America.\"\\nIf not for her husband Thomas Masters, Sybilla Masters\\' name, as so many women inventors before and after her, would have been lost to history. Thomas Masters stated in the patent submission that it was her idea and when the patent was issued, King George I stated publicly that it was her idea. Masters received her second patent, again under her husband\\'s name, for a method of weaving straw and palmetto leaves into hats and bonnets. She opened a shop in London that used this process and sold many popular hats and bonnets. Masters returned home to Pennsylvania on May 25, 1716.\\n\\nInvention details\\nMasters\\' first patent was awarded for a new method of the curing and preparation of cornmeal used a stamping process instead of grinding. The machine consisted of a long wooden cylinder with projections on each side which caused a series of heavy pestles to drop onto mortars filled with corn kernels. This invention was powered by horses or water wheels. It produced a product Masters named, \"Tuscarora Rice\" which was falsely advertised and sold as a cure for tuberculosis. While the product did not catch on in England, it became a staple of the southeastern diet and is today known as grits.\\nThe history of Masters and Tuscarora Rice was first described in 1844 by John Fanning Watson. Medical authorities have dismissed Tuscarora Rice as quackery.\\nMasters\\' second patent was awarded for a new process of making hats and bonnets using straw and palmetto leaves. The process was used to create many other woven goods as well, such as baskets, matting and furniture coverings.\\n\\nSee also\\nTimeline of United States inventions (before 1890)\\n\\nReferences\\nAdditional sources\\nBlashfield, Jean F. \"Sybilla Masters America\\'s First Patented Inventor.\" Women Inventors.

She is the co-founder of Uncharted Power, which made Soccket, a soccer ball that can be used as a power generator. Matthews attended Harvard College and graduated from Harvard Business School. In 2011, Fortune Magazine named her Fortune’s \"10 Most Powerful Women Entrepreneurs\" and in 2015, named her as Fortune’s \"Most Promising Women Entrepreneurs.\" In 2012, the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations named her \"Scientist of the Year.\" Matthews is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Nigeria. The President of Nigeria named Matthews an Ambassador for Entrepreneurship for the country.\\n\\nEarly life\\nMatthews grew up in Poughkeepsie, NY, as a dual citizen of the United States and Nigeria. Her parents run a software business, Decision Technologies International and her sister, Tiana Idoni-Matthews, would later become a marketing director of Uncharted Play. Matthews attended Our Lady of Lourdes High School, as a teenager pursuing science fairs and track and field. Matthews then attended Harvard College and later Harvard Business School.\\n\\nCareer\\nUncharted Play\\nAs a junior in college in 2008, Matthews and classmate Julia Silverman invented Soccket as part of an assignment for an engineering class. She has described the inspiration for the invention as coming from an experience attending her aunt\\'s wedding in Nigeria. When the electricity was lost and diesel generators were used to keep the lights on, Matthews recognized the health hazard posed from fumes and decided to try to do something about it. She and Silverman presented Soccket as their proposed solution, a soccer ball that stores kinetic energy as it\\'s used. A half-hour of play with the soccer ball generates enough energy to power a small, attachable LED light for three hours, so that play with soccer ball also provides children a reading light with which to do their homework after dark. The two founded Uncharted Power to develop Soccket, with Matthews becoming CEO.\\nAfter graduating from college in 2010, Matthews took a full-time job working at a crowd-funding company called CrowdTap. The following year, she left that company to work on Uncharted Power full-time, initially raising funds through Kickstarter and then utilizing convertible debt. That same year, she presented Soccket at the Clinton Global Initiative University and on President Barack Obama\\'s 2013 trip to Tanzania. The company also makes a jump rope that stores energy in a means similar to Soccket called the Pulse, which generates three hours of power for an LED through 15 minutes of jumping rope.\\nThe initial manufacturing run of Soccket encountered significant quality control issues, so Matthews moved production to Uncharted Play\\'s own facilities in New York. She subsequently shifted the company\\'s focus to developing a broader range of kinetic-energy-storying products in partnership with experienced manufacturers. This shift included trademarking MORE, an acronym for Motion-based Off-Grid Renewable Energy, a system which uses Soccket\\'s energy-storing method in consumer products beyond toys. \"Matthews describes her company’s proprietary MORE technology as an energy harvesting and emanating building block that can be seamlessly integrated into various infrastructures, objects and products — everything from floor panels, streets, speedbumps and sidewalks, to subway turnstiles, strollers, shopping carts and beyond\". In 2016, Uncharted Power had been profitable for three consecutive years and doubled gross profit margins year over year. In 2016, Matthews raised $7 million in Series A funding for Uncharted Power, with the company valued at $57 million. TechCrunch reported that this made Matthews the 13th black female founder to have raised more than $1 million in funding. As of March 2017, 500,000 Socckets and Pulses had been used in developing regions, primarily in Africa and Latin America.\\n\\nOther initiatives\\nIn 2016, when Matthews moved Uncharted Power to Harlem, NY, she created a non-profit arm, the Harlem Tech Fund (HTF), which aims to support 100 new startups and offer technology training to 10,000 Harlem residents over the next two to five years. Matthews serves as chairman of the board of HTF. That same year, she was recognized at the Harlem Economic Development Day, receiving the Outstanding Corporate Diversity Award.\\nMatthews has expanded to work on global infrastructure projects. She is co-founder and executive director of KDDC, developing a hydropower dam project in Nigeria. The 30-megawatt dam is among the first hydroelectric dam projects privatized in Nigeria.\\n\\nRecognition\\nMatthews has received numerous awards, honors and recognition, like being named Innovator of the Year by Black Enterprise in 2013, one of both Forbes 30 Under 30 and Inc. Magazine\\'s 30 under 30 in 2014 and 2016, respectively, and selected twice by Fortune for recognition.\\n\\nExternal links\\nOfficial SOCCKET product website\\nOfficial Uncharted Play website\\n\\n\\n== References =='), (1147, 'Melanie Joy Mayron (born October 20, 1952) is an American actress and director of film and television.

She was the first woman to be appointed Denver\\'s city toxicologist, the first female toxicologist in the Rocky Mountains, and probably the first female forensic pathologist in the United States.\\nMcConnell was raised in Colorado and after studying chemistry she became a high school teacher. She later attended medical school at the University of Colorado Denver, graduating in 1925. She specialized in the fields of toxicology and forensic pathology, which led her to testify in many high-profile criminal cases throughout her career. In addition to working as Denver\\'s city toxicologist, she held positions in multiple hospitals and administrative boards. After battling lifelong health problems, including rheumatic heart disease and a leg amputation, McConnell died in 1975. She was posthumously inducted into the Colorado Women\\'s Hall of Fame.\\n\\nEarly life\\nMcConnell-Mills was born Frances Mary McConnell in 1900 in Monument, Colorado. Her father was a physician and a pharmacist, and often took Frances with him when he made house calls to patients. She was sent to live with her aunt and grandfather so that she could attend Colorado Springs High School; she graduated at the age of 15 and was awarded a full scholarship to the University of Denver. She received a bachelor\\'s degree from the university in 1918, aged 17, and graduated again with a master\\'s degree in chemistry when she was 19, making her the university\\'s youngest graduate with a master\\'s degree at the time. In 1919, she began work as a teacher of chemistry, biology, geometry and trigonometry at Englewood High School.\\nMcConnell applied to the University of Colorado School of Medicine in 1920 and was accepted. Although her father had previously paid for 17 men to attend medical school, he refused to pay for Frances\\' tuition because he deemed medicine to be \"too hard a life for a woman\". She therefore supported herself through medical school by working as a musician in local bars and theaters, as a tutor, and as a laboratory assistant. In November 1925, she married David L. Mills, a lawyer, and gave birth to a daughter the year after. Although McConnell hyphenated her name to McConnell-Mills, she continued to use her maiden name for her professional career to avoid drawing attention to her children.\\n\\nCareer\\nMcConnell graduated from the University of Colorado as a Doctor of Medicine in 1925 and completed an internship at Denver General Hospital. She subsequently took on a position as a toxicologist in the coroner\\'s offices at the same hospital, making her the first female toxicologist in the Rocky Mountains area. She was appointed Denver\\'s city toxicologist in 1926 and became an assistant pathologist in 1927, working alongside deputy coroner George Bostwick and city pathologist W. S. Dennis. Her appointment to city toxicologist made her the first woman to hold the position.\\nMcConnell\\'s work mainly focused on poison and blood analysis, and she testified in many criminal cases as an expert witness. Her work often involved determining the cause of death when poisoning was suspected. In 1930, she investigated the death of a ten-year-old Denver girl; the case was referred to at the time as the city\\'s \"most famous and controversial murder case\". Although she initially suspected the girl had been poisoned, McConnell discovered crushed glass in the girl\\'s stomach and blood stains in the family car; her testimony led to the sentencing of the girl\\'s stepmother for murder. In 1936, McConnell testified against suspected rapist and murderer Joe Arridy after finding fibers from the bedspread at the murder scene under the suspect\\'s fingernails. (Although Arridy was convicted of murder and executed in 1939, he was granted a posthumous pardon in 2011.) McConnell also discovered that murder victim Georg Obendoerfer had been killed with a lethal dose of arsenic, which led to further investigations confirming that Anna Marie Hahn had killed Obendoerfer, as well as other men in the same way. McConnell testified at Hahn\\'s trial in Cincinnati and Hahn was subsequently convicted and executed. After she was called to Raton, New Mexico as a key witness in a murder trial in 1935, a court reporter for the Raton Range wrote that McConnell \"has gained a national reputation ... in her blood analysis work\". Additionally, she is thought to be the United States\\' first female forensic pathologist. Despite working on numerous high-profile, widely publicized cases, McConnell kept her life as private as possible and only ever gave one interview during her career.\\nOutside of toxicology, McConnell did extensive laboratory work. In the 1930s and 1940s she undertook personal research into passive immunity and developed serums for scarlet fever, polio, the common cold and acne for use on family members. While working for otolaryngologist Harry Baum, she invented a hair rinse which Baum called \"Noreen\" that was produced until the 1990s. In 1941, she was appointed director of the laboratory department of the Colorado State Board of Health, and she later founded Denver General Hospital\\'s School for Medical Technologists in order to train new workers, especially women. She enrolled in an advanced serology training program at the University of Michigan in 1941 and went on to study surgical pathology at the Cook County Hospital in Chicago in 1943. Following her term at Cook County, she resigned from the Board of Health and accepted a role at St. Luke\\'s Hospital in Denver as a laboratory director and pathologist. She was forced to leave St. Luke\\'s in 1944 due to illness, and after recovering she returned to Denver General Hospital as its laboratory director. She continued to work on criminal cases between other jobs until 1948.\\nIn the 1950s, McConnell joined physician and public health activist Florence R. Sabin to create an examination on behalf of the Colorado State Board of Basic Sciences for granting licenses to applicants who wished to practice health science. McConnell was appointed to the Board in 1956, making her the only female member at the time, and served until 1975.\\n\\nHealth problems and death\\nMcConnell battled with health problems throughout her life, after contracting rheumatic fever at the age of 20 which subsequently progressed to rheumatic heart disease. In 1944 she contracted appendicitis which required an emergency appendectomy; she developed deep vein thrombosis in her right leg after the surgery and her leg was subsequently amputated above the knee. She was given a prosthetic leg which she named \"Matilda\" but later became wheelchair-bound.\\nFollowing the death of her husband in 1967, McConnell lived alone. She kept working until the last two weeks of her life, filling various roles on the Board of Basic Sciences, in an allergy practice, and as a consultant for the Denver Poison Center. She died in December 1975 in St. Luke\\'s Hospital, Denver, at the age of 75.\\n\\nLegacy\\nA year before her death, in December 1974, McConnell received an award from the University of Colorado Medical School which recognized her as a 50-year graduate of the school and as one of only two Coloradoan women at the time who had practiced medicine for 50 years.\\nShe was inducted into the Colorado Women\\'s Hall of Fame in 1996. In 1999, her daughter Jeanne Varnell published a book titled Women of Consequence: The Colorado Women\\'s Hall of Fame, which contains the biographies of McConnell and 58 other inductees of the Hall of Fame. The project began when Varnell set out to write a biography of her mother, but was urged by her editor to do the same for all 59 of the women in the Hall of Fame at the time, and compile them into a book.\\n\\nReferences\\nWorks cited\\nVarnell, Jeanne (1999).

In 1939, she graduated as her high school’s valedictorian. She then enrolled at North Dakota\\'s Minot State University as a chemistry major.\\n\\nCareer\\nDuring Morgan\\'s college education the Second World War broke out. As a result of men going overseas, the United States soon developed a shortage of chemists and other scientists. A local employment recruiter heard that Sherman had chemistry knowledge, and offered her a job at a factory in Sandusky, Ohio. He would not tell her what product the factory made, or what her job would be—only that she would be required to obtain a \\'top secret\\' security clearance. Short on money, she decided to take the job even though it would mean having to postpone her degree. The job turned out to be at the Plum Brook Ordnance Works munitions factory, charged with the responsibility of manufacturing explosives trinitrotoluene (TNT), dinitrotoluene (DNT), and pentolite. The site produced more than one billion pounds of ordnance throughout World War II.\\nMary Sherman became pregnant in 1943 out of wedlock, a difficult dilemma in an era when this was considered extremely shameful and women were often given back-alley abortions or hidden from their friends and family. At that time she was living with her first cousin in Huron, Ohio. In 1944, she gave birth to a daughter, Mary G. Sherman, whom she later gave up for adoption to that cousin, Mary Hibbard and her husband, Irving. The child was renamed Ruth Esther.\\nAfter spending the war years designing explosives for the military, she applied for a job at North American Aviation, and was employed in their Rocketdyne Division, based in Canoga Park, California. Soon after being hired, she was promoted to Theoretical Performance Specialist, a job that required her to mathematically calculate the expected performance of new rocket propellants. Out of 900 engineers, she was the only woman, and one of only a few without a college degree.\\nWhile working at North American Aviation, she met her future husband, George Richard Morgan, a Mechanical Engineering graduate from Caltech. Together they had four children—George, Stephen, Monica and Karen.\\n\\nSpace race era\\nDuring the development program for the Jupiter missile, Wernher von Braun\\'s team used modified Redstone missiles, dubbed the Jupiter C, to accelerate the rocket to orbital velocities. In order to improve the performance of the first stage, they awarded a contract to North American Aviation\\'s Rocketdyne Division to come up with a more powerful fuel.\\nMorgan worked in the group of Dr. Jacob Silverman at North American Aviation\\'s Rocketdyne Division. Due to her expertise and experience with new rocket propellants, Morgan was named the technical lead on the contract. Morgan\\'s work resulted in a new propellant, Hydyne. The first Hydyne-powered Redstone R&D flight took place on 29 November 1956, and Hydyne subsequently powered three Jupiter C nose cone test flights.\\nIn 1957, the Soviet Union and the United States had set a goal of placing satellites into Earth orbit as part of a worldwide scientific celebration known as the International Geophysical Year. In this endeavor the United States effort was called Project Vanguard. The Soviet Union successfully launched the Sputnik satellite on October 4, 1957, an event followed soon after by a very public and disastrous explosion of a Vanguard rocket. Political pressure forced U.S. politicians to allow a former German rocket scientist, Wernher von Braun, to prepare his Jupiter C rocket for an orbital flight. In the renamed launcher (now called Juno I) the propellant succeeded in launching America’s first satellite, Explorer I, into orbit on January 31, 1958.\\nAfter the Jupiter C and six Juno I launches, the U.S. switched to more powerful fuels.\\n\\nAlternative fuel name\\nAs Hydyne-LOX (liquid oxygen) was the fuel combination used for the Redstone rocket, Morgan whimsically suggested naming her new fuel formulation Bagel, since the rocket\\'s propellant combination would then be called Bagel and LOX. Her suggested name for the new fuel was not accepted, and Hydyne was chosen instead by the U.S. Army. The standard Redstone was fueled with a 75% ethyl alcohol solution, but the Jupiter-C first stage had used Hydyne fuel, a blend of 60% unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) and 40% diethylenetriamine (DETA). This was a more powerful fuel than ethyl alcohol, but it was also more toxic. The fuel was used with the Rocketdyne Redstone rocket only once—to launch America\\'s first satellite Explorer I, after which it was discontinued in favor of higher performing fuels.\\n\\nDeath and tribute\\nA lifelong smoker, Morgan died of emphysema on August 4, 2004.

She invariably used the name \"Emmy Noether\" in her life and publications. She was described by Pavel Alexandrov, Albert Einstein, Jean Dieudonné, Hermann Weyl and Norbert Wiener as the most important woman in the history of mathematics. As one of the leading mathematicians of her time, she developed the theories of rings, fields, and algebras. In physics, Noether\\'s theorem explains the connection between symmetry and conservation laws.\\nNoether was born to a Jewish family in the Franconian town of Erlangen; her father was a mathematician, Max Noether. She originally planned to teach French and English after passing the required examinations, but instead studied mathematics at the University of Erlangen, where her father lectured. After completing her dissertation in 1907 under the supervision of Paul Gordan, she worked at the Mathematical Institute of Erlangen without pay for seven years. At the time, women were largely excluded from academic positions. In 1915, she was invited by David Hilbert and Felix Klein to join the mathematics department at the University of Göttingen, a world-renowned center of mathematical research. The philosophical faculty objected, however, and she spent four years lecturing under Hilbert\\'s name. Her habilitation was approved in 1919, allowing her to obtain the rank of Privatdozent.\\nNoether remained a leading member of the Göttingen mathematics department until 1933; her students were sometimes called the \"Noether boys\". In 1924, Dutch mathematician B. L. van der Waerden joined her circle and soon became the leading expositor of Noether\\'s ideas: Her work was the foundation for the second volume of his influential 1931 textbook, Moderne Algebra. By the time of her plenary address at the 1932 International Congress of Mathematicians in Zürich, her algebraic acumen was recognized around the world. The following year, Germany\\'s Nazi government dismissed Jews from university positions, and Noether moved to the United States to take up a position at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania. In 1935 she underwent surgery for an ovarian cyst and, despite signs of a recovery, died four days later at the age of 53.\\nNoether\\'s mathematical work has been divided into three \"epochs\". In the first (1908–1919), she made contributions to the theories of algebraic invariants and number fields. Her work on differential invariants in the calculus of variations, Noether\\'s theorem, has been called \"one of the most important mathematical theorems ever proved in guiding the development of modern physics\". In the second epoch (1920–1926), she began work that \"changed the face of [abstract] algebra\". In her classic 1921 paper Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen (Theory of Ideals in Ring Domains) Noether developed the theory of ideals in commutative rings into a tool with wide-ranging applications. She made elegant use of the ascending chain condition, and objects satisfying it are named Noetherian in her honor. In the third epoch (1927–1935), she published works on noncommutative algebras and hypercomplex numbers and united the representation theory of groups with the theory of modules and ideals. In addition to her own publications, Noether was generous with her ideas and is credited with several lines of research published by other mathematicians, even in fields far removed from her main work, such as algebraic topology.\\n\\nPrivate life\\nEmmy\\'s father, Max Noether, was descended from a family of wholesale traders in Germany. At age 14, he had been paralyzed by polio. He regained mobility, but one leg remained affected. Largely self-taught, he was awarded a doctorate from the University of Heidelberg in 1868. After teaching there for seven years, he took a position in the Bavarian city of Erlangen, where he met and married Ida Amalia Kaufmann, the daughter of a prosperous merchant.\\nMax Noether\\'s mathematical contributions were to algebraic geometry mainly, following in the footsteps of Alfred Clebsch. His best known results are the Brill–Noether theorem and the residue, or AF+BG theorem; several other theorems are associated with him; see Max Noether\\'s theorem.\\nEmmy Noether was born on 23 March 1882, the first of four children. Her first name was \"Amalie\", after her mother and paternal grandmother, but she began using her middle name at a young age.\\nAs a girl, Noether was well liked. She did not stand out academically although she was known for being clever and friendly. She was near-sighted and talked with a minor lisp during childhood. A family friend recounted a story years later about young Noether quickly solving a brain teaser at a children\\'s party, showing logical acumen at that early age. She was taught to cook and clean, as were most girls of the time, and she took piano lessons. She pursued none of these activities with passion, although she loved to dance.\\nShe had three younger brothers: The eldest, Alfred, was born in 1883, was awarded a doctorate in chemistry from Erlangen in 1909, but died nine years later. Fritz Noether, born in 1884, is remembered for his academic accomplishments; after studying in Munich he made a reputation for himself in applied mathematics. The youngest, Gustav Robert, was born in 1889. Very little is known about his life; he suffered from chronic illness and died in 1928. There is no record of Noether ever marrying or having children.\\n\\nUniversity education\\nNoether showed early proficiency in French and English. In the spring of 1900 she took the examination for teachers of these languages and received an overall score of sehr gut (very good). Her performance qualified her to teach languages at schools reserved for girls, but she chose instead to continue her studies at the University of Erlangen.\\nThis was an unconventional decision; two years earlier, the Academic Senate of the university had declared that allowing mixed-sex education would \"overthrow all academic order\". One of only two women in a university of 986 students, Noether was only allowed to audit classes rather than participate fully, and required the permission of individual professors whose lectures she wished to attend. Despite these obstacles, on 14 July 1903 she passed the graduation exam at a Realgymnasium in Nuremberg.\\nDuring the 1903–1904 winter semester, she studied at the University of Göttingen, attending lectures given by astronomer Karl Schwarzschild and mathematicians Hermann Minkowski, Otto Blumenthal, Felix Klein, and David Hilbert. Soon thereafter, restrictions on women\\'s participation in that university were rescinded.\\nNoether returned to Erlangen. She officially reentered the university in October 1904, and declared her intention to focus solely on mathematics. Under the supervision of Paul Gordan she wrote her dissertation, Über die Bildung des Formensystems der ternären biquadratischen Form (On Complete Systems of Invariants for Ternary Biquadratic Forms, 1907). Gordan was a member of the \"computational\" school of invariant researchers, and Noether\\'s thesis ended with a list of over 30019explicitly worked out invariants. This approach to invariants was later superseded by the more abstract and general approach pioneered by Hilbert. Although it had been well received, Noether later described her thesis and a number of subsequent similar papers she produced as \"crap\".\\n\\nTeaching\\nUniversity of Erlangen\\nFor the next seven years (1908–1915) she taught at the University of Erlangen\\'s Mathematical Institute without pay, occasionally substituting for her father when he was too ill to lecture. In 1910 and 1911 she published an extension of her thesis work from three variables to n variables.\\n\\nGordan retired in the spring of 1910, but continued to teach occasionally with his successor, Erhard Schmidt, who left shortly afterward for a position in Breslau. Gordan retired from teaching altogether in 1911 when Schmidt\\'s successor Ernst Fischer arrived; Gordan died a year later in December 1912.\\nAccording to Hermann Weyl, Fischer was an important influence on Noether, in particular by introducing her to the work of David Hilbert. From 1913–1916 Noether published several papers extending and applying Hilbert\\'s methods to mathematical objects such as fields of rational functions and the invariants of finite groups. This phase marks the beginning of her engagement with abstract algebra, the field of mathematics to which she would make groundbreaking contributions.\\nNoether and Fischer shared lively enjoyment of mathematics and would often discuss lectures long after they were over; Noether is known to have sent postcards to Fischer continuing her train of mathematical thoughts.\\n\\nUniversity of Göttingen\\nIn the spring of 1915, Noether was invited to return to the University of Göttingen by David Hilbert and Felix Klein. Their effort to recruit her, however, was blocked by the philologists and historians among the philosophical faculty: Women, they insisted, should not become privatdozent. One faculty member protested: \"What will our soldiers think when they return to the university and find that they are required to learn at the feet of a woman?\" Hilbert responded with indignation, stating, \"I do not see that the sex of the candidate is an argument against her admission as privatdozent. After all, we are a university, not a bath house.\"\\n\\nNoether left for Göttingen in late April; two weeks later her mother died suddenly in Erlangen. She had previously received medical care for an eye condition, but its nature and impact on her death is unknown. At about the same time Noether\\'s father retired and her brother joined the German Army to serve in World War I. She returned to Erlangen for several weeks, mostly to care for her aging father.\\nDuring her first years teaching at Göttingen she did not have an official position and was not paid; her family paid for her room and board and supported her academic work. Her lectures often were advertised under Hilbert\\'s name, and Noether would provide \"assistance\".\\nSoon after arriving at Göttingen, however, she demonstrated her capabilities by proving the theorem now known as Noether\\'s theorem, which shows that a conservation law is associated with any differentiable symmetry of a physical system. American physicists Leon M. Lederman and Christopher T. Hill argue in their book Symmetry and the Beautiful Universe that Noether\\'s theorem is \"certainly one of the most important mathematical theorems ever proved in guiding the development of modern physics, possibly on a par with the Pythagorean theorem\".\\n\\nWhen World War I ended, the German Revolution of 1918–1919 brought a significant change in social attitudes, including more rights for women. In 1919 the University of Göttingen allowed Noether to proceed with her habilitation (eligibility for tenure). Her oral examination was held in late May, and she successfully delivered her habilitation lecture in June 1919.\\nThree years later she received a letter from Otto Boelitz, the Prussian Minister for Science, Art, and Public Education, in which he conferred on her the title of nicht beamteter ausserordentlicher Professor (an untenured professor with limited internal administrative rights and functions). This was an unpaid \"extraordinary\" professorship, not the higher \"ordinary\" professorship, which was a civil-service position. Although it recognized the importance of her work, the position still provided no salary. Noether was not paid for her lectures until she was appointed to the special position of Lehrbeauftragte für Algebra a year later.\\n\\nWork in abstract algebra\\nAlthough Noether\\'s theorem had a significant effect upon classical and quantum mechanics, among mathematicians she is best remembered for her contributions to abstract algebra. In his introduction to Noether\\'s Collected Papers, Nathan Jacobson wrote that\\n\\nThe development of abstract algebra, which is one of the most distinctive innovations of twentieth century mathematics, is largely due to her – in published papers, in lectures, and in personal influence on her contemporaries.\\n\\nShe sometimes allowed her colleagues and students to receive credit for her ideas, helping them develop their careers at the expense of her own.\\nNoether\\'s work in algebra began in 1920. In collaboration with W. Schmeidler, she then published a paper about the theory of ideals in which they defined left and right ideals in a ring.\\nThe following year she published a paper called Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen, analyzing ascending chain conditions with regard to (mathematical) ideals. Noted algebraist Irving Kaplansky called this work \"revolutionary\"; the publication gave rise to the term \"Noetherian ring\" and the naming of several other mathematical objects as Noetherian.\\nIn 1924 a young Dutch mathematician, B. L. van der Waerden, arrived at the University of Göttingen. He immediately began working with Noether, who provided invaluable methods of abstract conceptualization. Van der Waerden later said that her originality was \"absolute beyond comparison\". In 1931 he published Moderne Algebra, a central text in the field; its second volume borrowed heavily from Noether\\'s work. Although Noether did not seek recognition, he included as a note in the seventh edition \"based in part on lectures by E. Artin and E. Noether\".\\nVan der Waerden\\'s visit was part of a convergence of mathematicians from all over the world to Göttingen, which became a major hub of mathematical and physical research. From 1926 to 1930 Russian topologist Pavel Alexandrov lectured at the university, and he and Noether quickly became good friends. He began referring to her as der Noether, using the masculine German article as a term of endearment to show his respect. She tried to arrange for him to obtain a position at Göttingen as a regular professor, but was only able to help him secure a scholarship from the Rockefeller Foundation. They met regularly and enjoyed discussions about the intersections of algebra and topology. In his 1935 memorial address, Alexandrov named Emmy Noether \"the greatest woman mathematician of all time\".\\n\\nGraduate students and influential lectures\\nIn addition to her mathematical insight, Noether was respected for her consideration of others. Although she sometimes acted rudely toward those who disagreed with her, she nevertheless gained a reputation for constant helpfulness and patient guidance of new students. Her loyalty to mathematical precision caused one colleague to name her \"a severe critic\", but she combined this demand for accuracy with a nurturing attitude. A colleague later described her this way:\\n\\nCompletely unegotistical and free of vanity, she never claimed anything for herself, but promoted the works of her students above all.\\n\\nGöttingen\\nIn Göttingen, Noether supervised more than a dozen doctoral students; her first was Grete Hermann, who defended her dissertation in February 1925. She later spoke reverently of her \"dissertation-mother\". Noether also supervised Max Deuring, who distinguished himself as an undergraduate and went on to contribute significantly to the field of arithmetic geometry; Hans Fitting, remembered for Fitting\\'s theorem and the Fitting lemma; and Zeng Jiongzhi (also rendered \"Chiungtze C. Tsen\" in English), who proved Tsen\\'s theorem. She also worked closely with Wolfgang Krull, who greatly advanced commutative algebra with his Hauptidealsatz and his dimension theory for commutative rings.\\nHer frugal lifestyle at first was due to being denied pay for her work; however, even after the university began paying her a small salary in 1923, she continued to live a simple and modest life. She was paid more generously later in her life, but saved half of her salary to bequeath to her nephew, Gottfried E. Noether.\\nMostly unconcerned about appearance and manners, biographers suggest she focused on her studies. A distinguished algebraist Olga Taussky-Todd described a luncheon, during which Noether, wholly engrossed in a discussion of mathematics, \"gesticulated wildly\" as she ate and \"spilled her food constantly and wiped it off from her dress, completely unperturbed\". Appearance-conscious students cringed as she retrieved the handkerchief from her blouse and ignored the increasing disarray of her hair during a lecture. Two female students once approached her during a break in a two-hour class to express their concern, but they were unable to break through the energetic mathematics discussion she was having with other students.\\nAccording to van der Waerden\\'s obituary of Emmy Noether, she did not follow a lesson plan for her lectures, which frustrated some students. Instead, she used her lectures as a spontaneous discussion time with her students, to think through and clarify important problems in mathematics. Some of her most important results were developed in these lectures, and the lecture notes of her students formed the basis for several important textbooks, such as those of van der Waerden and Deuring.\\nSeveral of her colleagues attended her lectures, and she allowed some of her ideas, such as the crossed product (verschränktes Produkt in German) of associative algebras, to be published by others. Noether was recorded as having given at least five semester-long courses at Göttingen:\\nWinter 1924/1925: Gruppentheorie und hyperkomplexe Zahlen [Group Theory and Hypercomplex Numbers]\\nWinter 1927/1928: Hyperkomplexe Grössen und Darstellungstheorie [Hypercomplex Quantities and Representation Theory]\\nSummer 1928: Nichtkommutative Algebra [Noncommutative Algebra]\\nSummer 1929: Nichtkommutative Arithmetik [Noncommutative Arithmetic]\\nWinter 1929/30: Algebra der hyperkomplexen Grössen [Algebra of Hypercomplex Quantities]\\nThese courses often preceded major publications on the same subjects.\\nNoether spoke quickly – reflecting the speed of her thoughts, many said – and demanded great concentration from her students. Students who disliked her style often felt alienated. Some pupils felt that she relied too much on spontaneous discussions. Her most dedicated students, however, relished the enthusiasm with which she approached mathematics, especially since her lectures often built on earlier work they had done together.\\nShe developed a close circle of colleagues and students who thought along similar lines and tended to exclude those who did not. \"Outsiders\" who occasionally visited Noether\\'s lectures usually spent only 30 minutes in the room before leaving in frustration or confusion. A regular student said of one such instance: \"The enemy has been defeated; he has cleared out.\"\\nNoether showed a devotion to her subject and her students that extended beyond the academic day. Once, when the building was closed for a state holiday, she gathered the class on the steps outside, led them through the woods, and lectured at a local coffee house. Later, after she had been dismissed by the Third Reich, she invited students into her home to discuss their plans for the future and mathematical concepts.\\n\\nMoscow\\nIn the winter of 1928–1929 Noether accepted an invitation to Moscow State University, where she continued working with P. S. Alexandrov. In addition to carrying on with her research, she taught classes in abstract algebra and algebraic geometry. She worked with the topologists, Lev Pontryagin and Nikolai Chebotaryov, who later praised her contributions to the development of Galois theory.\\n\\nAlthough politics was not central to her life, Noether took a keen interest in political matters and, according to Alexandrov, showed considerable support for the Russian Revolution. She was especially happy to see Soviet advances in the fields of science and mathematics, which she considered indicative of new opportunities made possible by the Bolshevik project. This attitude caused her problems in Germany, culminating in her eviction from a pension lodging building, after student leaders complained of living with \"a Marxist-leaning Jewess\".\\nNoether planned to return to Moscow, an effort for which she received support from Alexandrov. After she left Germany in 1933 he tried to help her gain a chair at Moscow State University through the Soviet Education Ministry. Although this effort proved unsuccessful, they corresponded frequently during the 1930s, and in 1935 she made plans for a return to the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, her brother Fritz accepted a position at the Research Institute for Mathematics and Mechanics in Tomsk, in the Siberian Federal District of Russia, after losing his job in Germany, and was subsequently executed during the Great Purge.\\n\\nRecognition\\nIn 1932 Emmy Noether and Emil Artin received the Ackermann–Teubner Memorial Award for their contributions to mathematics. The prize carried a monetary reward of 500 Reichsmarks and was seen as a long-overdue official recognition of her considerable work in the field. Nevertheless, her colleagues expressed frustration at the fact that she was not elected to the Göttingen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften (academy of sciences) and was never promoted to the position of Ordentlicher Professor (full professor).\\n\\nNoether\\'s colleagues celebrated her fiftieth birthday in 1932, in typical mathematicians\\' style. Helmut Hasse dedicated an article to her in the Mathematische Annalen, wherein he confirmed her suspicion that some aspects of noncommutative algebra are simpler than those of commutative algebra, by proving a noncommutative reciprocity law. This pleased her immensely. He also sent her a mathematical riddle, which he called the \"mμν-riddle of syllables\". She solved immediately, but the riddle has been lost.\\nIn November of the same year, Noether delivered a plenary address (großer Vortrag) on \"Hyper-complex systems in their relations to commutative algebra and to number theory\" at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Zürich. The congress was attended by 800 people, including Noether\\'s colleagues Hermann Weyl, Edmund Landau, and Wolfgang Krull. There were 420 official participants and twenty-one plenary addresses presented. Apparently, Noether\\'s prominent speaking position was a recognition of the importance of her contributions to mathematics. The 1932 congress is sometimes described as the high point of her career.\\n\\nExpulsion from Göttingen by the Third Reich\\nWhen Adolf Hitler became the German Reichskanzler in January 1933, Nazi activity around the country increased dramatically. At the University of Göttingen the German Student Association led the attack on the \"un-German spirit\" attributed to Jews and was aided by a privatdozent named Werner Weber, a former student of Noether. Antisemitic attitudes created a climate hostile to Jewish professors. One young protester reportedly demanded: \"Aryan students want Aryan mathematics and not Jewish mathematics.\"\\nOne of the first actions of Hitler\\'s administration was the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service which removed Jews and politically suspect government employees (including university professors) from their jobs unless they had \"demonstrated their loyalty to Germany\" by serving in World War I. In April 1933 Noether received a notice from the Prussian Ministry for Sciences, Art, and Public Education which read: \"On the basis of paragraph 3 of the Civil Service Code of 7 April 1933, I hereby withdraw from you the right to teach at the University of Göttingen.\" Several of Noether\\'s colleagues, including Max Born and Richard Courant, also had their positions revoked.\\nNoether accepted the decision calmly, providing support for others during this difficult time. Hermann Weyl later wrote that \"Emmy Noether—her courage, her frankness, her unconcern about her own fate, her conciliatory spirit—was in the midst of all the hatred and meanness, despair and sorrow surrounding us, a moral solace.\" Typically, Noether remained focused on mathematics, gathering students in her apartment to discuss class field theory. When one of her students appeared in the uniform of the Nazi paramilitary organization Sturmabteilung (SA), she showed no sign of agitation and, reportedly, even laughed about it later. This, however, was before the bloody events of Kristallnacht in 1938, and their praise from Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels.\\n\\nRefuge at Bryn Mawr and Princeton, in America\\nAs dozens of newly unemployed professors began searching for positions outside of Germany, their colleagues in the United States sought to provide assistance and job opportunities for them. Albert Einstein and Hermann Weyl were appointed by the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, while others worked to find a sponsor required for legal immigration. Noether was contacted by representatives of two educational institutions: Bryn Mawr College, in the United States, and Somerville College at the University of Oxford, in England. After a series of negotiations with the Rockefeller Foundation, a grant to Bryn Mawr was approved for Noether and she took a position there, starting in late 1933.\\nAt Bryn Mawr, Noether met and befriended Anna Wheeler, who had studied at Göttingen just before Noether arrived there. Another source of support at the college was the Bryn Mawr president, Marion Edwards Park, who enthusiastically invited mathematicians in the area to \"see Dr. Noether in action!\" Noether and a small team of students worked quickly through van der Waerden\\'s 1930 book Moderne Algebra I and parts of Erich Hecke\\'s Theorie der algebraischen Zahlen (Theory of algebraic numbers).\\nIn 1934, Noether began lecturing at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton upon the invitation of Abraham Flexner and Oswald Veblen. She also worked with and supervised Abraham Albert and Harry Vandiver. However, she remarked about Princeton University that she was not welcome at \"the men\\'s university, where nothing female is admitted\".\\nHer time in the United States was pleasant, surrounded as she was by supportive colleagues and absorbed in her favorite subjects. In the summer of 1934 she briefly returned to Germany to see Emil Artin and her brother Fritz before he left for Tomsk. Although many of her former colleagues had been forced out of the universities, she was able to use the library as a \"foreign scholar\".\\n\\nDeath\\nIn April 1935 doctors discovered a tumor in Noether\\'s pelvis. Worried about complications from surgery, they ordered two days of bed rest first. During the operation they discovered an ovarian cyst \"the size of a large cantaloupe\". Two smaller tumors in her uterus appeared to be benign and were not removed, to avoid prolonging surgery. For three days she appeared to convalesce normally, and she recovered quickly from a circulatory collapse on the fourth. On 14 April she fell unconscious, her temperature soared to 109 °F (42.8 °C), and she died. \"[I]t is not easy to say what had occurred in Dr. Noether\", one of the physicians wrote. \"It is possible that there was some form of unusual and virulent infection, which struck the base of the brain where the heat centers are supposed to be located.\"\\nA few days after Noether\\'s death her friends and associates at Bryn Mawr held a small memorial service at College President Park\\'s house. Hermann Weyl and Richard Brauer traveled from Princeton and spoke with Wheeler and Taussky about their departed colleague. In the months that followed, written tributes began to appear around the globe: Albert Einstein joined van der Waerden, Weyl, and Pavel Alexandrov in paying their respects. Her body was cremated and the ashes interred under the walkway around the cloisters of the M. Carey Thomas Library at Bryn Mawr.\\n\\nContributions to mathematics and physics\\nNoether\\'s work in abstract algebra and topology was influential in mathematics, while in physics, Noether\\'s theorem has consequences for theoretical physics and dynamical systems. She showed an acute propensity for abstract thought, which allowed her to approach problems of mathematics in fresh and original ways. Her friend and colleague Hermann Weyl described her scholarly output in three epochs:\\n\\nEmmy Noether\\'s scientific production fell into three clearly distinct epochs:\\n(1) the period of relative dependence, 1907–1919\\n(2) the investigations grouped around the general theory of ideals 1920–1926\\n(3) the study of the non-commutative algebras, their representations by linear transformations, and their application to the study of commutative number fields and their arithmetics\\n\\nIn the first epoch (1907–1919), Noether dealt primarily with differential and algebraic invariants, beginning with her dissertation under Paul Gordan. Her mathematical horizons broadened, and her work became more general and abstract, as she became acquainted with the work of David Hilbert, through close interactions with a successor to Gordan, Ernst Sigismund Fischer. After moving to Göttingen in 1915, she produced her work for physics, the two Noether\\'s theorems.\\nIn the second epoch (1920–1926), Noether devoted herself to developing the theory of mathematical rings.\\nIn the third epoch (1927–1935), Noether focused on noncommutative algebra, linear transformations, and commutative number fields.\\nAlthough the results of Noether\\'s first epoch were impressive and useful, her fame among mathematicians rests more on the groundbreaking work she did in her second and third epochs, as noted by Hermann Weyl and B. L. van der Waerden in their obituaries of her.\\nIn these epochs, she was not merely applying ideas and methods of earlier mathematicians; rather, she was crafting new systems of mathematical definitions that would be used by future mathematicians. In particular, she developed a completely new theory of ideals in rings, generalizing earlier work of Richard Dedekind. She is also renowned for developing ascending chain conditions, a simple finiteness condition that yielded powerful results in her hands. Such conditions and the theory of ideals enabled Noether to generalize many older results and to treat old problems from a new perspective, such as elimination theory and the algebraic varieties that had been studied by her father.\\n\\nHistorical context\\nIn the century from 1832 to Noether\\'s death in 1935, the field of mathematics – specifically algebra – underwent a profound revolution, whose reverberations are still being felt. Mathematicians of previous centuries had worked on practical methods for solving specific types of equations, e.g., cubic, quartic, and quintic equations, as well as on the related problem of constructing regular polygons using compass and straightedge. Beginning with Carl Friedrich Gauss\\'s 1832 proof that prime numbers such as five can be factored in Gaussian integers, Évariste Galois\\'s introduction of permutation groups in 1832 (although, because of his death, his papers were published only in 1846, by Liouville), William Rowan Hamilton\\'s discovery of quaternions in 1843, and Arthur Cayley\\'s more modern definition of groups in 1854, research turned to determining the properties of ever-more-abstract systems defined by ever-more-universal rules. Noether\\'s most important contributions to mathematics were to the development of this new field, abstract algebra.\\n\\nBackground on abstract algebra and begriffliche Mathematik (conceptual mathematics)\\nTwo of the most basic objects in abstract algebra are groups and rings.\\nA group consists of a set of elements and a single operation which combines a first and a second element and returns a third. The operation must satisfy certain constraints for it to determine a group: It must be closed (when applied to any pair of elements of the associated set, the generated element must also be a member of that set), it must be associative, there must be an identity element (an element which, when combined with another element using the operation, results in the original element, such as adding zero to a number or multiplying it by one), and for every element there must be an inverse element.\\nA ring likewise, has a set of elements, but now has two operations. The first operation must make the set a group, and the second operation is associative and distributive with respect to the first operation. It may or may not be commutative; this means that the result of applying the operation to a first and a second element is the same as to the second and first – the order of the elements does not matter. If every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse (an element x such that a\\u202fx = x\\u202fa = 1 ), the ring is called a division ring. A field is defined as a commutative division ring.\\nGroups are frequently studied through group representations. In their most general form, these consist of a choice of group, a set, and an action of the group on the set, that is, an operation which takes an element of the group and an element of the set and returns an element of the set. Most often, the set is a vector space, and the group represents symmetries of the vector space. For example, there is a group which represents the rigid rotations of space. This is a type of symmetry of space, because space itself does not change when it is rotated even though the positions of objects in it do. Noether used these sorts of symmetries in her work on invariants in physics.\\nA powerful way of studying rings is through their modules. A module consists of a choice of ring, another set, usually distinct from the underlying set of the ring and called the underlying set of the module, an operation on pairs of elements of the underlying set of the module, and an operation which takes an element of the ring and an element of the module and returns an element of the module.\\nThe underlying set of the module and its operation must form a group. A module is a ring-theoretic version of a group representation: Ignoring the second ring operation and the operation on pairs of module elements determines a group representation. The real utility of modules is that the kinds of modules that exist and their interactions, reveal the structure of the ring in ways that are not apparent from the ring itself. An important special case of this is an algebra. (The word algebra means both a subject within mathematics as well as an object studied in the subject of algebra.) An algebra consists of a choice of two rings and an operation which takes an element from each ring and returns an element of the second ring. This operation makes the second ring into a module over the first. Often the first ring is a field.\\nWords such as \"element\" and \"combining operation\" are very general, and can be applied to many real-world and abstract situations. Any set of things that obeys all the rules for one (or two) operation(s) is, by definition, a group (or ring), and obeys all theorems about groups (or rings). Integer numbers, and the operations of addition and multiplication, are just one example. For example, the elements might be computer data words, where the first combining operation is exclusive or and the second is logical conjunction. Theorems of abstract algebra are powerful because they are general; they govern many systems. It might be imagined that little could be concluded about objects defined with so few properties, but precisely therein lay Noether\\'s gift to discover the maximum that could be concluded from a given set of properties, or conversely, to identify the minimum set, the essential properties responsible for a particular observation. Unlike most mathematicians, she did not make abstractions by generalizing from known examples; rather, she worked directly with the abstractions. In his obituary of Noether, her student van der Waerden recalled that\\n\\nThe maxim by which Emmy Noether was guided throughout her work might be formulated as follows: \"Any relationships between numbers, functions, and operations become transparent, generally applicable, and fully productive only after they have been isolated from their particular objects and been formulated as universally valid concepts.\"\\n\\nThis is the begriffliche Mathematik (purely conceptual mathematics) that was characteristic of Noether. This style of mathematics was consequently adopted by other mathematicians, especially in the (then new) field of abstract algebra.\\n\\nExample: Integers as a ring\\nThe integers form a commutative ring whose elements are the integers, and the combining operations are addition and multiplication. Any pair of integers can be added or multiplied, always resulting in another integer, and the first operation, addition, is commutative, i.e., for any elements a and b in the ring, a + b = b + a. The second operation, multiplication, also is commutative, but that need not be true for other rings, meaning that a combined with b might be different from b combined with a. Examples of noncommutative rings include matrices and quaternions. The integers do not form a division ring, because the second operation cannot always be inverted; there is no integer a such that 3 × a = 1.\\nThe integers have additional properties which do not generalize to all commutative rings. An important example is the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which says that every positive integer can be factored uniquely into prime numbers. Unique factorizations do not always exist in other rings, but Noether found a unique factorization theorem, now called the Lasker–Noether theorem, for the ideals of many rings. Much of Noether\\'s work lay in determining what properties do hold for all rings, in devising novel analogs of the old integer theorems, and in determining the minimal set of assumptions required to yield certain properties of rings.\\n\\nFirst epoch (1908–1919): Algebraic invariant theory\\nMuch of Noether\\'s work in the first epoch of her career was associated with invariant theory, principally algebraic invariant theory. Invariant theory is concerned with expressions that remain constant (invariant) under a group of transformations. As an everyday example, if a rigid yardstick is rotated, the coordinates (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2) of its endpoints change, but its length L given by the formula L2 = Δx2 + Δy2 + Δz2 remains the same. Invariant theory was an active area of research in the later nineteenth century, prompted in part by Felix Klein\\'s Erlangen program, according to which different types of geometry should be characterized by their invariants under transformations, e.g., the cross-ratio of projective geometry.\\nAn example of an invariant is the discriminant B2 − 4\\u202fA\\u202fC of a binary quadratic form x·A\\u202fx + y·B\\u202fx + y·C\\u202fy , where x and y are vectors and \"·\" is the dot-product or \"inner product\" for the vectors. A, B, and C are linear operators on the vectors – typically matrices.\\nThe discriminant is called \"invariant\" because it is not changed by linear substitutions x → a\\u202fx + b\\u202fy, y → c\\u202fx + d\\u202fy with determinant a\\u202fd − b\\u202fc = 1 . These substitutions form the special linear group SL2.\\nOne can ask for all polynomials in A, B, and C that are unchanged by the action of SL2; these are called the invariants of binary quadratic forms and turn out to be the polynomials in the discriminant.\\nMore generally, one can ask for the invariants of homogeneous polynomials A0\\u202fxr\\u202fy0 + ... + Ar\\u202fx0\\u202fyr of higher degree, which will be certain polynomials in the coefficients A0, ..., Ar, and more generally still, one can ask the similar question for homogeneous polynomials in more than two variables.\\nOne of the main goals of invariant theory was to solve the \"finite basis problem\". The sum or product of any two invariants is invariant, and the finite basis problem asked whether it was possible to get all the invariants by starting with a finite list of invariants, called generators, and then, adding or multiplying the generators together. For example, the discriminant gives a finite basis (with one element) for the invariants of binary quadratic forms.\\nNoether\\'s advisor, Paul Gordan, was known as the \"king of invariant theory\", and his chief contribution to mathematics was his 1870 solution of the finite basis problem for invariants of homogeneous polynomials in two variables. He proved this by giving a constructive method for finding all of the invariants and their generators, but was not able to carry out this constructive approach for invariants in three or more variables. In 1890, David Hilbert proved a similar statement for the invariants of homogeneous polynomials in any number of variables. Furthermore, his method worked, not only for the special linear group, but also for some of its subgroups such as the special orthogonal group.\\n\\nFirst epoch (1908–1919): Galois theory\\nGalois theory concerns transformations of number fields that permute the roots of an equation. Consider a polynomial equation of a variable x of degree n, in which the coefficients are drawn from some ground field, which might be, for example, the field of real numbers, rational numbers, or the integers modulo 7. There may or may not be choices of x, which make this polynomial evaluate to zero. Such choices, if they exist, are called roots. If the polynomial is x2 + 1 and the field is the real numbers, then the polynomial has no roots, because any choice of x makes the polynomial greater than or equal to one. If the field is extended, however, then the polynomial may gain roots, and if it is extended enough, then it always has a number of roots equal to its degree.\\nContinuing the previous example, if the field is enlarged to the complex numbers, then the polynomial gains two roots, +i and −i, where i is the imaginary unit, that is, i 2 = −1 . More generally, the extension field in which a polynomial can be factored into its roots is known as the splitting field of the polynomial.\\nThe Galois group of a polynomial is the set of all transformations of the splitting field which preserve the ground field and the roots of the polynomial. (In mathematical jargon, these transformations are called automorphisms.) The Galois group of x2 + 1 consists of two elements: The identity transformation, which sends every complex number to itself, and complex conjugation, which sends +i to −i. Since the Galois group does not change the ground field, it leaves the coefficients of the polynomial unchanged, so it must leave the set of all roots unchanged. Each root can move to another root, however, so transformation determines a permutation of the n roots among themselves. The significance of the Galois group derives from the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, which proves that the fields lying between the ground field and the splitting field are in one-to-one correspondence with the subgroups of the Galois group.\\nIn 1918, Noether published a paper on the inverse Galois problem. Instead of determining the Galois group of transformations of a given field and its extension, Noether asked whether, given a field and a group, it always is possible to find an extension of the field that has the given group as its Galois group. She reduced this to \"Noether\\'s problem\", which asks whether the fixed field of a subgroup G of the permutation group Sn acting on the field k(x1, ... , xn) always is a pure transcendental extension of the field k. (She first mentioned this problem in a 1913 paper, where she attributed the problem to her colleague Fischer.) She showed this was true for n = 2, 3, or 4. In 1969, R. G. Swan found a counter-example to Noether\\'s problem, with n = 47 and G a cyclic group of order 47 (although this group can be realized as a Galois group over the rationals in other ways). The inverse Galois problem remains unsolved.\\n\\nFirst epoch (1908–1919): Physics\\nNoether was brought to Göttingen in 1915 by David Hilbert and Felix Klein, who wanted her expertise in invariant theory to help them in understanding general relativity, a geometrical theory of gravitation developed mainly by Albert Einstein. Hilbert had observed that the conservation of energy seemed to be violated in general relativity, because gravitational energy could itself gravitate. Noether provided the resolution of this paradox, and a fundamental tool of modern theoretical physics, with Noether\\'s first theorem, which she proved in 1915, but did not publish until 1918. She not only solved the problem for general relativity, but also determined the conserved quantities for every system of physical laws that possesses some continuous symmetry. Upon receiving her work, Einstein wrote to Hilbert:\\n\\nYesterday I received from Miss Noether a very interesting paper on invariants. I\\'m impressed that such things can be understood in such a general way. The old guard at Göttingen should take some lessons from Miss Noether! She seems to know her stuff.\\n\\nFor illustration, if a physical system behaves the same, regardless of how it is oriented in space, the physical laws that govern it are rotationally symmetric; from this symmetry, Noether\\'s theorem shows the angular momentum of the system must be conserved. The physical system itself need not be symmetric; a jagged asteroid tumbling in space conserves angular momentum despite its asymmetry. Rather, the symmetry of the physical laws governing the system is responsible for the conservation law. As another example, if a physical experiment has the same outcome at any place and at any time, then its laws are symmetric under continuous translations in space and time; by Noether\\'s theorem, these symmetries account for the conservation laws of linear momentum and energy within this system, respectively.\\nNoether\\'s theorem has become a fundamental tool of modern theoretical physics, both because of the insight it gives into conservation laws, and also, as a practical calculation tool. Her theorem allows researchers to determine the conserved quantities from the observed symmetries of a physical system. Conversely, it facilitates the description of a physical system based on classes of hypothetical physical laws. For illustration, suppose that a new physical phenomenon is discovered. Noether\\'s theorem provides a test for theoretical models of the phenomenon:\\n\\nIf the theory has a continuous symmetry, then Noether\\'s theorem guarantees that the theory has a conserved quantity, and for the theory to be correct, this conservation must be observable in experiments.\\n\\nSecond epoch (1920–1926): Ascending and descending chain conditions\\nIn this epoch, Noether became famous for her deft use of ascending (Teilerkettensatz) or descending (Vielfachenkettensatz) chain conditions. A sequence of non-empty subsets A1, A2, A3, etc. of a set S is usually said to be ascending, if each is a subset of the next\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          A\\n          \\n            1\\n          \\n        \\n        ⊂\\n        \\n          A\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        ⊂\\n        \\n          A\\n          \\n            3\\n          \\n        \\n        ⊂\\n        ⋯\\n        .\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle A_{1}\\\\subset A_{2}\\\\subset A_{3}\\\\subset \\\\cdots .}\\n  \\nConversely, a sequence of subsets of S is called descending if each contains the next subset:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          A\\n          \\n            1\\n          \\n        \\n        ⊃\\n        \\n          A\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        ⊃\\n        \\n          A\\n          \\n            3\\n          \\n        \\n        ⊃\\n        ⋯\\n        .\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle A_{1}\\\\supset A_{2}\\\\supset A_{3}\\\\supset \\\\cdots .}\\n  \\nA chain becomes constant after a finite number of steps if there is an n such that \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          A\\n          \\n            n\\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          A\\n          \\n            m\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle A_{n}=A_{m}}\\n   for all m ≥ n. A collection of subsets of a given set satisfies the ascending chain condition if any ascending sequence becomes constant after a finite number of steps. It satisfies the descending chain condition if any descending sequence becomes constant after a finite number of steps.\\nAscending and descending chain conditions are general, meaning that they can be applied to many types of mathematical objects—and, on the surface, they might not seem very powerful. Noether showed how to exploit such conditions, however, to maximum advantage.\\nFor example: How to use chain conditions to show that every set of sub-objects has a maximal/minimal element or that a complex object can be generated by a smaller number of elements. These conclusions often are crucial steps in a proof.\\nMany types of objects in abstract algebra can satisfy chain conditions, and usually if they satisfy an ascending chain condition, they are called Noetherian in her honor. By definition, a Noetherian ring satisfies an ascending chain condition on its left and right ideals, whereas a Noetherian group is defined as a group in which every strictly ascending chain of subgroups is finite. A Noetherian module is a module in which every strictly ascending chain of submodules becomes constant after a finite number of steps. A Noetherian space is a topological space in which every strictly ascending chain of open subspaces becomes constant after a finite number of steps; this definition makes the spectrum of a Noetherian ring a Noetherian topological space.\\nThe chain condition often is \"inherited\" by sub-objects. For example, all subspaces of a Noetherian space, are Noetherian themselves; all subgroups and quotient groups of a Noetherian group are likewise, Noetherian; and, mutatis mutandis, the same holds for submodules and quotient modules of a Noetherian module. All quotient rings of a Noetherian ring are Noetherian, but that does not necessarily hold for its subrings. The chain condition also may be inherited by combinations or extensions of a Noetherian object. For example, finite direct sums of Noetherian rings are Noetherian, as is the ring of formal power series over a Noetherian ring.\\nAnother application of such chain conditions is in Noetherian induction—also known as well-founded induction—which is a generalization of mathematical induction. It frequently is used to reduce general statements about collections of objects to statements about specific objects in that collection. Suppose that S is a partially ordered set. One way of proving a statement about the objects of S is to assume the existence of a counterexample and deduce a contradiction, thereby proving the contrapositive of the original statement. The basic premise of Noetherian induction is that every non-empty subset of S contains a minimal element. In particular, the set of all counterexamples contains a minimal element, the minimal counterexample. In order to prove the original statement, therefore, it suffices to prove something seemingly much weaker: For any counter-example, there is a smaller counter-example.\\n\\nSecond epoch (1920–1926): Commutative rings, ideals, and modules\\nNoether\\'s paper, Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen (Theory of Ideals in Ring Domains, 1921), is the foundation of general commutative ring theory, and gives one of the first general definitions of a commutative ring. Before her paper, most results in commutative algebra were restricted to special examples of commutative rings, such as polynomial rings over fields or rings of algebraic integers. Noether proved that in a ring which satisfies the ascending chain condition on ideals, every ideal is finitely generated. In 1943, French mathematician Claude Chevalley coined the term, Noetherian ring, to describe this property. A major result in Noether\\'s 1921 paper is the Lasker–Noether theorem, which extends Lasker\\'s theorem on the primary decomposition of ideals of polynomial rings to all Noetherian rings. The Lasker–Noether theorem can be viewed as a generalization of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic which states that any positive integer can be expressed as a product of prime numbers, and that this decomposition is unique.\\nNoether\\'s work Abstrakter Aufbau der Idealtheorie in algebraischen Zahl- und Funktionenkörpern (Abstract Structure of the Theory of Ideals in Algebraic Number and Function Fields, 1927) characterized the rings in which the ideals have unique factorization into prime ideals as the Dedekind domains: integral domains that are Noetherian, 0- or 1-dimensional, and integrally closed in their quotient fields. This paper also contains what now are called the isomorphism theorems, which describe some fundamental natural isomorphisms, and some other basic results on Noetherian and Artinian modules.\\n\\nSecond epoch (1920–1926): Elimination theory\\nIn 1923–1924, Noether applied her ideal theory to elimination theory in a formulation that she attributed to her student, Kurt Hentzelt. She showed that fundamental theorems about the factorization of polynomials could be carried over directly. Traditionally, elimination theory is concerned with eliminating one or more variables from a system of polynomial equations, usually by the method of resultants.\\nFor illustration, a system of equations often can be written in the form   M\\u202fv = 0   where a matrix (or linear transform)   M   (without the variable x) times a vector v (that only has non-zero powers of x) is equal to the zero vector, 0. Hence, the determinant of the matrix   M   must be zero, providing a new equation in which the variable x has been eliminated.\\n\\nSecond epoch (1920–1926): Invariant theory of finite groups\\nTechniques such as Hilbert\\'s original non-constructive solution to the finite basis problem could not be used to get quantitative information about the invariants of a group action, and furthermore, they did not apply to all group actions. In her 1915 paper, Noether found a solution to the finite basis problem for a finite group of transformations   G   acting on a finite-dimensional vector space over a field of characteristic zero. Her solution shows that the ring of invariants is generated by homogeneous invariants whose degree is less than, or equal to, the order of the finite group; this is called Noether\\'s bound. Her paper gave two proofs of Noether\\'s bound, both of which also work when the characteristic of the field is coprime to   |G|!   (the factorial of the order   |G|   of the group G). The degrees of generators need not satisfy Noether\\'s bound when the characteristic of the field divides the number   |G| , but Noether was not able to determine whether this bound was correct when the characteristic of the field divides   |G|!   but not   |G| . For many years, determining the truth or falsehood of this bound for this particular case was an open problem, called \"Noether\\'s gap\". It was finally solved independently by Fleischmann in 2000 and Fogarty in 2001, who both showed that the bound remains true.\\nIn her 1926 paper, Noether extended Hilbert\\'s theorem to representations of a finite group over any field; the new case that did not follow from Hilbert\\'s work is when the characteristic of the field divides the order of the group. Noether\\'s result was later extended by William Haboush to all reductive groups by his proof of the Mumford conjecture. In this paper Noether also introduced the Noether normalization lemma, showing that a finitely generated domain A over a field k has a set   { x1, ... , xn }   of algebraically independent elements such that A is integral over   k\\u202f[x1, ... , xn] .\\n\\nSecond epoch (1920–1926): Contributions to topology\\nAs noted by Pavel Alexandrov and Hermann Weyl in their obituaries, Noether\\'s contributions to topology illustrate her generosity with ideas and how her insights could transform entire fields of mathematics. In topology, mathematicians study the properties of objects that remain invariant even under deformation, properties such as their connectedness. An old joke is that \"a topologist cannot distinguish a donut from a coffee mug\", since they can be continuously deformed into one another.\\nNoether is credited with fundamental ideas that led to the development of algebraic topology from the earlier combinatorial topology, specifically, the idea of homology groups. According to the account of Alexandrov, Noether attended lectures given by Heinz Hopf and by him in the summers of 1926 and 1927, where \"she continually made observations which were often deep and subtle\" and he continues that,\\n\\nWhen ... she first became acquainted with a systematic construction of combinatorial topology, she immediately observed that it would be worthwhile to study directly the groups of algebraic complexes and cycles of a given polyhedron and the subgroup of the cycle group consisting of cycles homologous to zero; instead of the usual definition of Betti numbers, she suggested immediately defining the Betti group as the complementary (quotient) group of the group of all cycles by the subgroup of cycles homologous to zero. This observation now seems self-evident. But in those years (1925–1928) this was a completely new point of view.\\n\\nNoether\\'s suggestion that topology be studied algebraically was adopted immediately by Hopf, Alexandrov, and others, and it became a frequent topic of discussion among the mathematicians of Göttingen. Noether observed that her idea of a Betti group makes the Euler–Poincaré formula simpler to understand, and Hopf\\'s own work on this subject \"bears the imprint of these remarks of Emmy Noether\". Noether mentions her own topology ideas only as an aside in a 1926 publication, where she cites it as an application of group theory.\\nThis algebraic approach to topology was also developed independently in Austria. In a 1926–1927 course given in Vienna, Leopold Vietoris defined a homology group, which was developed by Walther Mayer, into an axiomatic definition in 1928.\\n\\nThird epoch (1927–1935): Hypercomplex numbers and representation theory\\nMuch work on hypercomplex numbers and group representations was carried out in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but remained disparate. Noether united these results and gave the first general representation theory of groups and algebras.\\nBriefly, Noether subsumed the structure theory of associative algebras and the representation theory of groups into a single arithmetic theory of modules and ideals in rings satisfying ascending chain conditions. This single work by Noether was of fundamental importance for the development of modern algebra.\\n\\nThird epoch (1927–1935): Noncommutative algebra\\nNoether also was responsible for a number of other advances in the field of algebra. With Emil Artin, Richard Brauer, and Helmut Hasse, she founded the theory of central simple algebras.\\nA paper by Noether, Helmut Hasse, and Richard Brauer pertains to division algebras, which are algebraic systems in which division is possible. They proved two important theorems: a local-global theorem stating that if a finite-dimensional central division algebra over a number field splits locally everywhere then it splits globally (so is trivial), and from this, deduced their Hauptsatz (\"main theorem\"):\\n\\nevery finite dimensional central division algebra over an algebraic number field F splits over a cyclic cyclotomic extension.\\n\\nThese theorems allow one to classify all finite-dimensional central division algebras over a given number field. A subsequent paper by Noether showed, as a special case of a more general theorem, that all maximal subfields of a division algebra D are splitting fields. This paper also contains the Skolem–Noether theorem which states that any two embeddings of an extension of a field k into a finite-dimensional central simple algebra over k, are conjugate. The Brauer–Noether theorem gives a characterization of the splitting fields of a central division algebra over a field.\\n\\nAssessment, recognition, and memorials\\nNoether\\'s work continues to be relevant for the development of theoretical physics and mathematics and she is consistently ranked as one of the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century. In his obituary, fellow algebraist BL van der Waerden says that her mathematical originality was \"absolute beyond comparison\", and Hermann Weyl said that Noether \"changed the face of algebra by her work\". During her lifetime and even until today, Noether has been characterized as the greatest woman mathematician in recorded history by mathematicians such as Pavel Alexandrov, Hermann Weyl, and Jean Dieudonné.\\nIn a letter to The New York Times, Albert Einstein wrote:\\n\\nIn the judgment of the most competent living mathematicians, Fräulein Noether was the most significant creative mathematical genius thus far produced since the higher education of women began. In the realm of algebra, in which the most gifted mathematicians have been busy for centuries, she discovered methods which have proved of enormous importance in the development of the present-day younger generation of mathematicians.\\n\\nOn 2 January 1935, a few months before her death, mathematician Norbert Wiener wrote that \\n\\nMiss Noether is ... the greatest woman mathematician who has ever lived; and the greatest woman scientist of any sort now living, and a scholar at least on the plane of Madame Curie.\\n\\nAt an exhibition at the 1964 World\\'s Fair devoted to Modern Mathematicians, Noether was the only woman represented among the notable mathematicians of the modern world.\\nNoether has been honored in several memorials,\\nThe Association for Women in Mathematics holds a Noether Lecture to honor women in mathematics every year; in its 2005 pamphlet for the event, the Association characterizes Noether as \"one of the great mathematicians of her time, someone who worked and struggled for what she loved and believed in. Her life and work remain a tremendous inspiration\".\\nConsistent with her dedication to her students, the University of Siegen houses its mathematics and physics departments in buildings on the Emmy Noether Campus.\\nThe German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) operates the Emmy Noether Programme, providing funding to early-career researchers to rapidly qualify for a leading position in science and research by leading an independent junior research group.\\nA street in her hometown, Erlangen, has been named after Emmy Noether and her father, Max Noether.\\nThe successor to the secondary school she attended in Erlangen has been renamed as the Emmy Noether School.\\nA series of high school workshops and competitions are held in her honor in May of each year since 2001, originally hosted by a subsequent woman mathematics Privatdozent of the University of Göttingen.\\nPerimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics annually awards Emmy Noether Visiting Fellowships to outstanding female theoretical physicists. Perimeter Institute is also home to the Emmy Noether Council, a group of volunteers made up of international community, corporate and philanthropic leaders work together to increase the number of women in physics and mathematical physics at Perimeter Institute.\\nThe Emmy Noether Mathematics Institute in Algebra, Geometry and Function Theory in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Gan, Israel was jointly founded in 1992 by the university, the German government and the Minerva Foundation with the aim to stimulate research in the above fields and to encourage collaborations with Germany. Its main topics are Algebraic Geometry, Group theory and Complex Function Theory. Its activities includes local research projects, conferences, short-term visitors, post-doc fellowships, and the Emmy Noether lectures (an annual series of distinguished lectures).

January 31] 1881 – January 23, 1931) was a Russian prima ballerina of the late 19th and the early 20th centuries. She was a principal artist of the Imperial Russian Ballet and the Ballets Russes of Sergei Diaghilev. Pavlova is most recognized for the creation of the role The Dying Swan and, with her own company, became the first ballerina to tour ballet around the world. She toured South America and India.\\n\\nEarly life\\nAnna Pavlovna (Matveyevna) Pavlova was born on February 12, 1881 in Ligovo, Saint Petersburg, Russia to unwed parents. Her mother, Lyubov Feodorovna, was a laundress. Her father\\'s identity is unknown. When she was about three years old her mother married Matvey Pavlov, who adopted her and gave her his surname.\\n\\nPavlova\\'s passion for the art of ballet was ignited when her mother took her to a performance of Marius Petipa\\'s original production of The Sleeping Beauty at the Imperial Maryinsky Theater. The lavish spectacle made an impression on Pavlova. When she was nine, her mother took her to audition for the renowned Imperial Ballet School. Because of her youth, and what was considered her \"sickly\" appearance, she was rejected, but at age 10 in 1891 she was accepted. She appeared for the first time on stage in Marius Petipa\\'s Un conte de fées (A Fairy Tale), which the ballet master staged for the students of the school.\\n\\nImperial Ballet School\\nYoung Pavlova\\'s years of training were difficult. Classical ballet did not come easily to her. Her severely arched feet, thin ankles, and long limbs clashed with the small, compact body favoured for the ballerina of the time. Her fellow students taunted her with such nicknames as The broom and La petite sauvage (The little savage). Undeterred, Pavlova trained to improve her technique. She would practice and practice after learning a step. She said, \"No one can arrive from being talented alone. God gives talent, work transforms talent into genius.\" She took extra lessons from the noted teachers of the day—Christian Johansson, Pavel Gerdt, Nikolai Legat—and from Enrico Cecchetti, considered the greatest ballet virtuoso of the time and founder of the Cecchetti method, a very influential ballet technique used to this day. In 1898, she entered the classe de perfection of Ekaterina Vazem, former Prima ballerina of the Saint Petersburg Imperial Theatres.\\nDuring her final year at the Imperial Ballet School, she performed many roles with the principal company. She graduated in 1899 at age 18, chosen to enter the Imperial Ballet a rank ahead of corps de ballet as a coryphée. She made her official début at the Mariinsky Theatre in Pavel Gerdt\\'s Les Dryades prétendues (The False Dryads). Her performance drew praise from the critics, particularly the great critic and historian Nikolai Bezobrazov.\\n\\nCareer\\nSt. Petersburg\\nMarius Petipa\\nAt the height of Petipa\\'s strict academicism, the public was taken aback by Pavlova\\'s style, a combination of a gift that paid little heed to academic rules: she frequently performed with bent knees, bad turnout, misplaced port de bras and incorrectly placed tours. Such a style in many ways harked back to the time of the romantic ballet and the great ballerinas of old.\\nPavlova performed in various classical variations, pas de deux and pas de trois in such ballets as La Camargo, Le Roi Candaule, Marcobomba and The Sleeping Beauty. Her enthusiasm often led her astray: once during a performance as the River Thames in Petipa\\'s The Pharaoh\\'s Daughter her energetic double pique turns led her to lose her balance, and she ended up falling into the prompter\\'s box. Her weak ankles led to difficulty while performing as the fairy Candide in Petipa\\'s The Sleeping Beauty, leading the ballerina to revise the fairy\\'s jumps en pointe, much to the surprise of the Ballet Master. She tried desperately to imitate the renowned Pierina Legnani, Prima ballerina assoluta of the Imperial Theaters. Once during class she attempted Legnani\\'s famous fouettés, causing her teacher Pavel Gerdt to fly into a rage. He told her,\\n\\n... leave acrobatics to others. It is positively more than I can bear to see the pressure such steps put on your delicate muscles and the severe arch of your foot. I beg you to never again try to imitate those who are physically stronger than you. You must realize that your daintiness and fragility are your greatest assets. You should always do the kind of dancing which brings out your own rare qualities instead of trying to win praise by mere acrobatic tricks.\\n\\nPavlova rose through the ranks quickly, becoming a favorite of the old maestro Petipa. It was from Petipa himself that Pavlova learned the title role in Paquita, Princess Aspicia in The Pharaoh\\'s Daughter, Queen Nisia in Le Roi Candaule, and Giselle. She was named danseuse in 1902, première danseuse in 1905, and finally prima ballerina in 1906 after a resounding performance in Giselle. Petipa revised many grand pas for her, as well as many supplemental variations. She was much celebrated by the fanatical balletomanes of Tsarist Saint Petersburg, her legions of fans calling themselves the Pavlovatzi.\\nWhen the ballerina Mathilde Kschessinska was pregnant in 1901, she coached Pavlova in the role of Nikya in La Bayadère. Kschessinska, not wanting to be upstaged, was certain Pavlova would fail in the role, as she was considered technically inferior because of her small ankles and lithe legs. Instead audiences became enchanted with Pavlova and her frail, ethereal look, which fitted the role perfectly, particularly in the scene The Kingdom of the Shades.\\n\\nMichel Fokine\\nPavlova is perhaps most renowned for creating the role of The Dying Swan, a solo choreographed for her by Michel Fokine. The ballet, created in 1905, is danced to Le cygne from The Carnival of the Animals by Camille Saint-Saëns. Pavlova also choreographed several solos herself, one of which is The Dragonfly, a short ballet set to music by Fritz Kreisler. While performing the role, Pavlova wore a gossamer gown with large dragonfly wings fixed to the back.\\nPavlova had a rivalry with Tamara Karsavina. According to the film A Portrait of Giselle, Karsavina recalls a wardrobe malfunction. During one performance her shoulder straps fell and she accidentally exposed herself, and Pavlova reduced an embarrassed Karsavina to tears.\\n\\nBallets Russes\\nIn the first years of the Ballets Russes, Pavlova worked briefly for Sergei Diaghilev. Originally she was to dance the lead in Mikhail Fokine\\'s The Firebird, but refused the part, as she could not come to terms with Igor Stravinsky\\'s avant-garde score, and the role was given to Tamara Karsavina. All her life Pavlova preferred the melodious \"musique dansante\" of the old maestros such as Cesare Pugni and Ludwig Minkus, and cared little for anything else which strayed from the salon-style ballet music of the 19th century.\\n\\nPavlova\\'s ballet company\\nTouring the world\\nAfter the first Paris season of Ballets Russes, Pavlova left it to form her own company. It performed throughout the world, with a repertory consisting primarily of abridgements of Petipa\\'s works, and specially choreographed pieces for herself. Going independent was\\n\\n\"a very enterprising and daring act. She toured on her own... for twenty years until her death. She traveled everywhere in the world that travel was possible, and introduced the ballet to millions who had never seen any form of Western dancing.\"\\n\\nPavlova also performed many ‘ethnic’ dances, some of which she learned from local teachers during her travels. In addition to the dances of her native Russia, she performed Mexican, Japanese, and East Indian dances. Supported by her interest, Uday Shankar, her partner in Krishna Radha (1923), went on to revive the long-neglected art of the dance in his native India.  She also toured China.\\nIn 1916 she produced a fifty-minute adaptation of The Sleeping Beauty in New York City. Members of her company were largely English girls with Russianized names. One of her dancers, Kathleen Crofton, was reviewed by the ballet writer Cyril Johnson, he said that \"her bourrées were like a string of pearls\". From 1918-1919 her company toured throughout South America, during which time Pavlova exerted an influence on the young American ballerina Ruth Page.  \\nIn 1915, she appeared in a film, The Dumb Girl of Portici, in which she played a mute girl betrayed by an aristocrat.\\n\\nEngland\\nAfter leaving Russia, Pavlova moved to London, England, settling, in 1912, at the Ivy House on North End Road, Golders Green, north of Hampstead Heath, where she lived for the rest of her life. The house had an ornamental lake where she fed her pet swans, and where now stands a statue of her by the Scots sculptor George Henry Paulin. The house was featured in the film Anna Pavlova. It is now the London Jewish Cultural Centre, but a blue plaque marks it as a site of significant historical interest being Pavlova\\'s home. While in London, Pavlova was influential in the development of British ballet, most notably inspiring the career of Alicia Markova. The Gate pub, located on the border of Arkley and Totteridge (London Borough of Barnet), has a story, framed on its walls, describing a visit by Pavlova and her dance company.\\nThere are at least five memorials to Pavlova in London, England: a contemporary sculpture by Tom Merrifield of Pavlova as the Dragonfly in the grounds of Ivy House, a sculpture by Scot George Henry Paulin in the middle of the Ivy House pond, a blue plaque on the front of Ivy House, a statuette sitting with the urn that holds her ashes in Golders Green Crematorium, and the gilded statue atop the Victoria Palace Theatre.\\nWhen the Victoria Palace Theatre in London, England, opened in 1911, a gilded statue of Pavlova had been installed above the cupola of the theatre. This was taken down for its safety during World War II and was lost. In 2006, a replica of the original statue was restored in its place.\\n\\nThe United States\\nBetween 1912 and 1926, Pavlova made almost annual tours of America, traveling from coast to coast.\\n\\n\"A generation of dancers turned to the art because of her. She roused America as no one had done since Elssler. ... America became Pavlova-conscious and therefore ballet-conscious. Dance and passion, dance and drama were fused.\"\\n\\nBoston\\nPavlova was introduced to audiences in the United States by Max Rabinoff during his time as managing director of the Boston Grand Opera Company from 1914 to 1917 and was featured there with her Russian Ballet Company during that period.\\nSt. Louis\\nIn 1914 Pavlova performed in St. Louis Missouri, after being engaged last minute by Hattie B. Gooding, responsible for a series of worthy musical attractions presented to the St. Louis public during the season of 1913-14. Gooding went to New York to arrange with the musical managers for the attractions offered. Out of a long list she selected those who represent the highest in their own special field, and which she felt sure St. Louisans would enjoy. The list began with Madame Louise Homer prima donna contralto of the Metropolitan Grand Opera Co., followed by Josef Hoffman, pianist, and Anna Pavlova and the Russian ballet. For the last the expenses were $5,500.00 ($136,185 in 2017 dollars) for two nights, and the receipts $7,500.00 ($185,707 in 2017 dollars), netting a clear gain of $2,000.00 ($49,522 in 2017 dollars); her other evenings were proportionately successful financially. The advance sales were greater than any other city in the United States. At the Pavlowa concert, when Gooding engaged, at the last hour, the Russian dancer for two nights, the New York managers became dubious and anxiously rushed four special advance agents to assist her. On seeing the bookings for both nights they quietly slipped back to New York fully convinced of her ability to attract audiences in St. Louis, which had always, heretofore, been called \"the worst show town\" in the country.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nVictor Dandré, her manager and companion, asserted he was her husband in his biography of the dancer in 1932: Anna Pavlova: In Art & Life (Dandre 1932, author\\'s foreword). On death (5 February 1944) he was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium and his ashes placed below those of Anna.\\nVictor Dandré wrote of Pavlova\\'s many charity dance performances and charitable efforts to support Russian orphans in post-World War I Paris\\n\\n...who were in danger of finding themselves literally in the street. They were already suffering terrible privations and it seemed as though there would soon be no means whatever to carry on their education.\\n\\nFifteen girls were adopted into a home Pavlova purchased near Paris at Saint-Cloud, overseen by the Comtesse de Guerne and supported by her performances and funds solicited by Pavlova, including many small donations from members of the Camp Fire Girls of America who made her an honorary member.\\nDuring her life she had many pets including a Siamese cat, various dogs and many kinds of birds, including swans. Dandré indicated she was a lifelong lover of animals and this is evidenced by photographic portraits she sat for which often included an animal she loved. A formal studio portrait was made of her with Jack, her favorite swan.\\n\\nDeath\\nWhile touring in The Hague, Pavlova was told that she had pneumonia and required an operation. She was also told that she would never be able to dance again if she went ahead with it. She refused to have the surgery, saying \"If I can\\'t dance then I\\'d rather be dead.\" She died of pleurisy, in the bedroom next to the Japanese Salon of the Hotel Des Indes in The Hague, three weeks short of her 50th birthday.\\nVictor Dandré wrote that Anna Pavlova died a half hour past midnight on Friday, January 23, 1931, with her maid Marguerite Letienne, Dr. Zalevsky and himself at her bedside. Her last words were, \"Get my \\'Swan\\' costume ready.\"\\nIn accordance with old ballet tradition, on the day she was to have next performed, the show went on as scheduled, with a single spotlight circling an empty stage where she would have been. Memorial services were held in the Russian Orthodox Church in London. Anna Pavlova was cremated, and her ashes placed in a columbarium at Golders Green Crematorium, where her urn was adorned with her ballet shoes (which have since been stolen).\\nPavlova\\'s ashes have been a source of much controversy, following attempts by Valentina Zhilenkova and Moscow mayor Yury Luzhkov to have them flown to Moscow for interment in the Novodevichy Cemetery. These attempts were based on claims that it was Pavlova\\'s dying wish that her ashes be returned to Russia following the fall of the Soviet Union. These claims were later found to be false, as there is no evidence to suggest that this was her wish at all. The only documentary evidence that suggests that such a move would be possible is in the will of Pavlova\\'s husband, who stipulated that if Russian authorities agreed to such a move and treated her remains with proper reverence, then the crematorium caretakers should agree to it. Despite this clause, the will does not contain a formal request or plans for a posthumous journey to Russia.\\nThe most recent attempt to move Pavlova\\'s remains to Russia came in 2001. Golders Green Crematorium had made arrangements for them to be flown to Russia for interment on 14 March 2001, in a ceremony to be attended by various Russian dignitaries. This plan was later abandoned after Russian authorities withdrew permission for the move. It was later revealed that neither Pavlova\\'s family nor the Russian Government had sanctioned the move and that they had agreed the remains should stay in London.\\n\\nLegacy\\nPavlova inspired the choreographer Frederick Ashton when as a boy of 13 he saw her dance in the Municipal Theater in Lima, Peru.\\nThe Pavlova dessert is believed to have been created in honour of the dancer in Wellington during her tour of New Zealand and Australia in the 1920s. The nationality of its creator has been a source of argument between the two nations for many years.\\nThe Jarabe Tapatío, known in English as the \\'Mexican Hat Dance\\', gained popularity outside of Mexico when Pavlova created a staged version in pointe shoes, for which she was showered with hats by her adoring Mexican audiences. Afterward, in 1924, the Jarabe Tapatío was proclaimed Mexico\\'s national dance.\\nAnna Pavlova was able to complete 37 turns while on top of a moving elephant while on a tour in China.\\nIn 1980, Igor Carl Faberge licensed a collection of 8-inch Full Lead Crystal Wine Glasses to commemorate the centenary of Anna\\'s birth. The glasses were crafted in Japan under the supervision of The Franklin Mint. A frosted image of Anna Pavlova appears in the stem of each glass. Originally each set contained 12 glasses.\\nPavlova\\'s life was depicted in the 1983 film Anna Pavlova.\\nPavlova\\'s dances inspired many artworks of the Irish painter John Lavery. The critic of The Observer wrote on 16 April 1911: \\'Mr. Lavery\\'s portrait of the Russian dancer Anna Pavlova, caught in a moment of graceful, weightless movement … Her miraculous, feather-like flight, which seems to defy the law of gravitation\\'.\\nA McDonnell Douglas MD-11 of the Dutch airline KLM, with the registration PH-KCH carried her name. It was delivered on August 31, 1995.\\nAnna Pavlova appears as a character in Rosario Ferre\\'s novel Flight of the Swan.\\nAnna Pavlova appears as a character in the fourth episode of the British series Mr Selfridge, played by real-life ballerina Natalia Kremen.\\n\\nPointe shoes\\nHer feet were extremely rigid, so she strengthened her pointe shoe by adding a piece of hard wood on the soles for support and curving the box of the shoe. At the time, many considered this \"cheating\", for a ballerina of the era was taught that she, not her shoes, must hold her weight en pointe. In Pavlova\\'s case this was extremely difficult, as the shape of her feet required her to balance her weight on her little toes. Her solution became, over time, the precursor of the modern pointe shoe, as pointe work became less painful and easier for curved feet. According to Margot Fonteyn\\'s biography, Pavlova did not like the way her invention looked in photographs, so she would remove it or have the photographs altered so that it appeared she was using a normal pointe shoe.\\n\\nChoreographic notation\\nAt the turn-of-the-Twentieth century, the Imperial Ballet began a project that notated much of its repertory in the Stepanov method of choreographic notation. Most of the notated choreographies were recorded while dancers were being taken through rehearsals. After the revolution of 1917, this collection of notation was taken out of Russia by the Imperial Ballet\\'s former régisseur Nicholas Sergeyev, who utilized these documents to stage such works as The Nutcracker, The Sleeping Beauty and Swan Lake, as well as Marius Petipa\\'s definitive versions of Giselle and of Coppélia for the Paris Opéra Ballet and the Vic-Wells Ballet of London (precursor of the Royal Ballet). The productions of these works formed the foundation from which all subsequent versions would be based to one extent or another. Eventually these notations were acquired by Harvard University, and are now part of the cache of materials relating to the Imperial Ballet known as the Sergeyev Collection that includes not only the notated ballets but rehearsal scores as used by the company at the turn-of-the-twentieth century.\\nThe notations of Giselle and the full-length Paquita were recorded circa 1901-1902 while Marius Petipa himself took Anna Pavlova through rehearsals. Pavlova is also included in some of the other notated choreographies when she participated in performances as a soloist. Several of the violin or piano reductions used as rehearsal scores reflect the variations that Pavlova chose to dance in a particular performance, since at that time classical variations were often performed ad libitum, i.e. at the dancer\\'s choice. One variation in particular was performed by Pavlova in several ballets, being composed by Riccardo Drigo for Pavlova\\'s performance in Petipa\\'s ballet Le Roi candaule that features a solo harp. This variation is still performed in modern times in the Mariinsky Ballet\\'s staging of the Paquita grand pas classique.\\n\\nGallery\\nSee also\\nList of Russian ballet dancers\\nWomen in dance\\n\\nNotes\\nSources\\nDandré, Victor (1932).

She is most famous for her invention of the spanning-tree protocol (STP), which is fundamental to the operation of network bridges, while working for Digital Equipment Corporation. She also made large contributions to many other areas of network design and standardization, such as link-state routing protocols.\\nMore recently she has invented the TRILL protocol to correct some of the shortcomings of spanning-trees. She is currently employed by Dell EMC.\\n\\nEarly life\\nPerlman grew up near Asbury Park, New Jersey. Both of her parents worked as engineers for the US government. Her father worked on radar and her mother was a mathematician by training who worked as computer programmer. At school math and science were “effortless and fascinating” to Perlman. Though she achieved As also in subjects she was less fond of, because she memorised facts, dates and names in advance of tests. She enjoyed playing the piano and French horn. While her mother helped her with her math homework, they mainly talked about literature and music.\\nDespite being the best science and math student in her school it was only when Perlman took a programming class in high school that she started to consider a career that involved computers. She was the only woman in the class and later reflected \"I was not a hands-on type person. It never occurred to me to take anything apart. I assumed I\\'d either get electrocuted, or I\\'d break something\".\\n\\nEducation\\nAs an undergraduate at MIT Perlman learned programming for a physics class. She was given her first paid job in 1971 as part-time programmer for the LOGO Lab at the (then) MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, programming system software such as debuggers.\\nWorking under the supervision of Seymour Papert, she developed a child-friendly version of the educational robotics language LOGO, called TORTIS (\"Toddler\\'s Own Recursive Turtle Interpreter System\"). During research performed in 1974–76, young children—the youngest aged 3½ years, programmed a LOGO educational robot called a Turtle. Perlman has been described as a pioneer of teaching young children computer programming.\\nAs a math grad at the MIT she needed to find an adviser for her thesis, and joined the MIT group at BBN Technologies. There she first got involved with designing network protocols. Perlman obtained a B.S. and M.S. in Mathematics and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from MIT in 1988. Her doctoral thesis at MIT addressed the issue of routing in the presence of malicious network failures.\\nWhen studying at MIT in the late 60s she was one among the 50 or so women students, in a class of about 1,000 students. To begin with the MIT only had one women’s dorm, limiting the number of women students that could study. When the men’s dorms at MIT became coed Perlman moved out of the women’s dorm into a mixed dorm, where she became the \"resident female\". She later said that she was so used to the gender imbalance, that it became normal. Only when she saw other women students among a crowd of men she noticed that \"it kind of looked weird\".\\n\\nCareer\\nShe is most famous for her invention of the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), which is fundamental to the operation of network bridges, while working for Digital Equipment Corporation. Perlman is the author of a textbook on networking and coauthor of another on network security. She holds more than 100 issued patents. She was a Fellow at Sun Microsystems and has taught courses at the University of Washington, Harvard University and MIT, and has been the keynote speaker at events all over the world. Perlman is the recipient of awards such as Lifetime Achievement awards from Usenix and the Association for Computing Machinery’s Special Interest Group on Data Communication (SIGCOMM).\\n\\nSpanning Tree Protocol\\nPerlman invented the spanning tree algorithm and the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP). While working as a consulting engineer at the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in 1984 she was tasked with developing a straightforward protocol which enabled network bridges to locate loops in a local area network (LAN). It was required that the protocol should use a constant amount of memory when implemented on the network devices, regardless how large the network was. Building and expanding bridged networks was difficult because loops, where more than one path leads to the same destination, could result to the collapse of the network. Redundant paths in the network meant that a bridge could forward a frame in multiple directions. Therefore loops could cause Ethernet frames to not reach their destination, flooding the network. Perlman utilised the fact that bridges had unique 48 bit MAC addresses, and devised a network protocol so that bridges within the LAN communicated with one another. The algorithm implemented on all bridges in the network allowed the bridges to designate one root bridge in the network. Each bridge then mapped the network and determined the shortest path to the root bridge, deactivating other redundant paths. Despite Perlman\\'s concerns that it took the spanning tree protocol about a minute to react when changes in the network topology occurred, in which time a loop could bring down the network, it was standardised as 802.1d by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Perlman said that the benefits of the protocol amount to the fact that \"you don\\'t have to worry about topology\" when changing the way a LAN is interconnected. Perlman has however criticised that changes were made in the course of the standardisation of the protocol.\\nFrom the paper \"An Algorithm for Distributed Computation of a Spanning Tree in an Extended LAN\":[1]\\n\\nAlgorhyme\\n\\nI think that I shall never see\\nA graph more lovely than a tree.\\n\\nA tree whose crucial property\\nIs loop-free connectivity.\\n\\nA tree which must be sure to span\\nSo packets can reach every LAN.\\n\\nFirst the root must be selected.\\nBy ID it is elected.\\n\\nLeast cost paths from root are traced.\\nIn the tree these paths are placed.\\n\\nA mesh is made by folks like me\\nThen bridges find a spanning tree.\\n\\nOther network protocols\\nPerlman was the principal designer of the DECnet IV and V protocols, which are part of the DECnet network protocol suite for peer-to-peer network architectures. She also made major contributions to the Connectionless Network Protocol (CLNP). Perlman has collaborated with Yakov Rekhter on developing network routing standards, such as the Open System Interconnection Routing Protocol (IDRP), which allows routers in packet switching networks to communicate with one another across broadcast domains. At DEC she also oversaw the transition from distance vector to link-state routing protocols. Link-state routing protocols had the advantage that they adapted to changes in the network topology faster, and DEC\\'s link-state routing protocol was second only to the link-state routing protocol of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET). While working on the DECnet project Perlman also helped to improve the intermediate-system to intermediate-system routing protocol, known as IS-IS, so that it could route the Internet Protocol (IP), AppleTalk and the Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) protocol.\\nPerlman subsequently worked as network engineer for Sun Microsystems, now Oracle. She specialised on network and security protocols and while working for Oracle obtained more than 50 patents.\\n\\nAwards\\nNational Inventors Hall of Fame induction (2016)\\nInternet Hall of Fame induction (2014)\\nSIGCOMM Award (2010)\\nUSENIX Lifetime Achievement Award (2006)\\nRecipient of the first Anita Borg Institute Women of Vision Award for Innovation in 2005\\nSilicon Valley Intellectual Property Law Association Inventor of the year (2003)\\nHonorary Doctorate, Royal Institute of Technology (June 28, 2000)\\nTwice named as one of the 20 most influential people in the industry by Data Communications magazine: in the 20th anniversary issue (January 15, 1992) and the 25th anniversary issue (January 15, 1997).

Phillips is the creator and founder of Lindsay Phillips, a shoe and accessories company exclusively for women.\\n\\nBiography\\nPhillips was born in Clearwater, Florida on Dec 7, 1984. Her father, Paul Phillips, is a cardiologist and her mother, Liz Phillips, worked as a nurse. Phillips attended Berkeley Preparatory School in Tampa, Florida. It was during this time that Lindsay developed the concept for sandals that would eventually lead her to launch SwitchFlops - interchangeable flip-flops with removable straps to match any outfit. Encouraged by the favorable responses she received after creating ceramic flips flops – part of an art class project – she began expanding her vision by toying with the idea of creating colorful straps and buttons that could diversify the look of just one pair of flip flops. She soon realized that by using hook-and-loop fasteners, her vision of “Change Your Look, Not Your Sole” was complete. By the end of her high school career, Phillips applied for a patent.\\nFollowing graduation from Berkeley Prep in 2003, she attended Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida, interning with Ralph Lauren Corporation in New York City during two of her summer breaks. She also attended Semester at Sea, a shipboard, global study abroad program, during which she simultaneously studied and toured several countries including Venezuela, Brazil, South Africa, the Republic of Maurituis, Myanmar, India, Vietnam, China, and Japan. Phillips has frequently commented that her travels abroad have greatly influenced her designs. She graduated in 2007 with a BA in Art History and a minor in communications.\\n\\nCareer\\nPhillips’ career began in high school with an idea she developed in an art class. In 2004, Phillips received her patent, and with the help of her mother Liz, began searching for a manufacturer.

She invented clothes irons with detachable wooden handles that became prominent throughout North America and the European continent. She termed herself an \"inventress\".\\n\\nEarly life\\nPotts was born with the maiden name Webber. Some sources say she was born in Ohio and other sources say in Iowa. Her parents were Jacob Hanec Webber (from Pennsylvania) and Anna Nancy McGinley (from Ohio). Her exact birth date is unknown and recorded by various sources as from November 1, 1850, to 1853.\\n\\nMid life and career\\nPotts is associated with improvements to the sadiron (a/k/a sad iron and sad-iron) that she made from the age of 19. The old English word of sad before the \"iron\" meant heavy, dense, and solid. Potts\\'s patented double-pointed shaped clothes iron was made of hollow rather than solid metal. The flat iron\\'s bottom was of thick iron and the sides were thin sheets of iron. The hollow iron was poured and filled with material that was a poor conductor of heat, such as cement or clay. Since her father was a plasterer by trade she experimented on filling some with a type of plaster of Paris. The advantage of these materials was that they did not radiate heat up like the predecessor old-style conventional solid metal clothes irons. Her patent claimed it retained heat longer and as a result would need less reheating.\\nThe conventional solid metal clothes iron of the nineteenth century weighed around 5 pounds (2.3 kg) to 10 pounds (4.5 kg) and had to be heated on a stove. It was so hot, that often a rag or thick cloth mitt was utilized to touch the metal handle without burning of the fingers. Once this all metal iron cooled down, the ironing job at hand had to stop until it was reheated. The advantage of Potts\\'s system was that there was always a waiting heated base ready to be switched out with the used cooled base, so the ironing could continue immediately.\\nThe most pronounced feature of Potts\\'s clothes iron was a detachable rounded wooden handle. That allowed the iron base to be placed on a heated stovetop and the handle removed at that time to stay away and cool while the base heated up. This prevented burned fingers, that often happened with the conventional all-solid-metal clothes iron of the nineteenth century. The handle and bases were designed standard and could be easily reattached to various sizes after they were heated for little delay in ironing.\\nInitially, Potts sold her innovative clothes iron, but later it was franchised out and manufactured by the American Machine Company of Philadelphia. This company marketed the clothes iron in a kit package that contained one wooden handle mechanism that attached to three iron bases. The handle could only connect to Potts\\'s iron bases, in effect tripling sales of these clothes irons over that of conventional solid metal irons.\\nPotts\\'s double-pointed clothes iron became a standard household appliance widely used throughout North America and the European continent. Because of its shape, it was more efficient in pressing clothes as it could be operated in both directions. Potts\\'s patented invention of her various styles of clothes irons were the most popular ever used. The 1876 Philadelphia Exposition World\\'s Fair displayed Potts\\'s cold-handled sadiron and it was popular through the century. Her cold handle innovative clothes iron was also a favorite item at the 1893 Chicago World\\'s Fair.\\n\\nFamily\\nShe married Joseph Potts and they had a family of six children.\\n\\nPatents\\nShe was awarded three United States patents. Potts had two patents for metal flat iron improvements in 1871–1872. In addition she held an invention for a medical device that her husband helped make. Potts termed herself as an \"inventress\" — a Victorian expression.\\n\\nLegacy\\nPotts\\'s innovation of a removable handle mechanism of 1871 was later implemented by Gillette in 1901 – some thirty years later. Gillette\\'s application was a removable disposable blade and reinsertion of a sharp blade. This was a spin-off of Potts\\'s removable cooled clothes iron base that could be reattached to a preheated base ready to go for ironing. This concept presaged the twentieth-century construction industry concept for portable hand tools with removable exhausted battery packs that can be reattached to fully charged batteries.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography =='), (1162, 'Sylvia Ratnasamy (born c. 1976) is a Belgian-Indian computer scientist.

Her career spanned from the 1830s - 1870s, making her a contemporary to the much more widely celebrated suffragists Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. Largely forgotten in contemporary discussions of the American women\\'s rights movement, she was one of its major intellectual forces in nineteenth-century America. Her relationship with Judaism is a debated motivation for her advocacy.\\n\\nLife and work\\nShe was born on January 13, 1810, in Piotrków Trybunalski, Congress Poland, as Ernestine Louise Potowska. Her father was a wealthy rabbi. There is no information about her mother. At the age of five, Rose began to \"question the justice of a God who would exact such hardships\" as the frequent fasts that her father performed. As she grew older, she began to question her father more and more on religious matters. He told her, \"Little girls should not ask questions,\" unlike little boys who were supposed to. She later said that she dated her disbelief and women\\'s rights principles from that event.\\nWhen she was sixteen her mother died and left her an inheritance. Her father, without her consent, betrothed her to a Jewish friend of his, to \"bind her more closely to the bosom of the synagogue.\" Rose, not wanting to enter a marriage with a man she neither chose nor loved, confronted him, professing her lack of affection towards him and begging for release. However, Rose was a woman from a rich family, and he denied her plea. Rose traveled to the secular civil court, where she pleaded her case herself. The courts ruled in her favor, not only freeing her from her betrothal, but ruling that she could retain the full inheritance she received from her mother. Although she decided to relinquish the fortune to her father, she gladly took her freedom from betrothal. She returned home only to discover that in her absence her father had remarried, to a sixteen-year-old girl. The tension that developed eventually forced her to leave home at the age of seventeen.\\nRose then traveled to Berlin, where she found herself hampered by an anti-Semitic law that required all non-Prussian Jews to have a Prussian sponsor. She appealed directly to the king and was granted an exemption from the rule. Soon afterward, she invented a room deodorizer, which she sold to fund her travels.\\nShe traveled to Belgium, the Netherlands, France, and finally England. Her arrival in England was less than smooth, however, as the ship in which she was sailing was shipwrecked. Although Rose did make it to England safely, all her possessions had been destroyed, and she found herself destitute. In order to support herself, she sought work as a teacher of the German and Hebrew languages and she continued to sell her room deodorizers. While in England, she met Robert Owen, a Utopian socialist, who was so impressed by her that he invited her to speak in a large hall for radical speakers. In spite of her limited knowledge of English, the audience was so impressed that from then on her appearances were regular. She and Owen were close friends, and she even helped him to found the Association of All Classes of All Nations, a group that espoused human rights for all people of all nations, sexes, races and classes. During her time there she also met William Ella Rose, a Christian jeweler and silversmith, an Englishman and an \"Owenite\". They were soon married by a civil magistrate, and both made it plain that they considered the marriage a civil contract rather than a religious one.\\nIn May 1836 the Roses emigrated to the United States, where they later became naturalized citizens and settled in a cozy house in New York city in 1837. The Roses soon opened a small \"Fancy and Perfumery\" store in their home, where Rose sold her perfumed toilet water and William ran a silversmith shop.\\nRose soon began to give lectures on the subjects that most interested her, joining the \"Society for Moral Philanthropists\" and traveling to different states to espouse her causes of the abolition of slavery, religious tolerance, public education and equality for women. Her lectures were met with controversy. When she was in the South to speak out against slavery, one slaveholder told her he would have \"tarred and feathered her if she had been a man\". When, in 1855, she was invited to deliver an anti-slavery lecture in Bangor, Maine, a local newspaper called her \"a female Atheist... a thousand times below a prostitute.\" When Rose responded to the slur in a letter to the competing paper, she sparked off a town feud that created such publicity that, by the time she arrived, everyone in town was eager to hear her. Her most ill-received lecture was likely in Charleston, West Virginia, where her lecture on the evils of slavery was met with such vehement opposition and outrage that she was forced to exercise considerable influence to even get out of the city safely.\\nIn the 1840s and 1850s, Rose joined the \"pantheon of great American women\", a group that included such influential women as Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Lucretia Mott, Paulina Kellogg Wright Davis and Sojourner Truth and fought for women\\'s rights and abolition.\\nIn the winter of 1836, Judge Thomas Hertell submitted a married women\\'s property act to the New York State Legislature to investigate methods of improving the civil and property rights of married women, and to allow them to hold real estate in their own name. When Rose heard of this resolution, she drew up a petition and began to solicit names in support of it. In 1838, this petition was sent to the state legislature in spite of it only having five names. This was the first petition ever introduced in favor of rights for women. During the following years, she increased both the number of petitions and the number of signatures. In 1849, these rights were finally won.\\nRose also attended and spoke at numerous conferences and conventions, including, but not limited to: the first national convention of Infidels, the Hartford Bible Convention, the Women\\'s Rights Convention in the Tabernacle, New York City, the tenth national convention of the National Women\\'s Rights Convention in Cooper Institute, New York City, the State Women\\'s Rights Convention in Albany, New York, and the Equal Rights Association meeting in which there was a schism.\\nRose was elected president of the National Women\\'s Rights Convention in October, 1854, in spite of objections that she was an atheist. Her election was heavily supported by Susan B. Anthony, who declared that \"every religion – or none – should have an equal right on the platform\".\\nAlthough she never seemed to attach great importance to her Jewish background, in 1863 Rose had a published debate with Horace Seaver, the abolitionist editor of the Boston Investigator, whom she accused of being antisemitic.\\nIn 1869, she successfully lobbied for legislation in New York that allowed married women to retain their own property and have equal guardianship of children in New York.\\nIn her later years, after a six-month trip to Europe, she attempted to stay away from platforms and controversy. Within 6 months, she made the closing address at the nationwide Women\\'s Rights Convention. However, her health once again took a downward turn, and on June 8, 1869, she and her husband set sail for England. Susan B. Anthony arranged a farewell party for them, and the couple received many gifts from friends and admirers, including a substantial amount of money.\\nAfter 1873, her health improved, and she began to advocate women\\'s suffrage in England, even attending the Conference of the Woman\\'s Suffrage movement in London and speaking in Edinburgh, Scotland at a large public meeting in favor of woman\\'s suffrage. She died in Brighton, England in 1892.\\n\\nQuotations\\n\"It is an interesting and demonstrable fact, that all children are atheists and were religion not inculcated into their minds, they would remain so.\"\\n\"Do you tell me that the Bible is against our rights? Then I say that our claims do not rest upon a book written no one knows when, or by whom. Do you tell me what Paul or Peter says on the subject? Then again I reply that our claims do not rest on the opinions of any one, not even on those of Paul and Peter, . . . Books and opinions, no matter from whom they came, if they are in opposition to human rights, are nothing but dead letters.\"—Ernestine Rose, responding to religious heckler at Seventh National Woman\\'s Rights Convention, New York, November 25–26, 1856 (History of Woman Suffrage, Vol. 1: 661-663)\\n\"...The wisest of all ages have acknowledged that the most important period in human education is in childhood. . - - This most important part of education is left entirely in the hands of the mother. She prepares the soil for future culture. . . . But the mother cannot give what she does not possess; weakness cannot impart strength. With an imperfect education . . . can she develop the powers, call out the energies, and impart a spirit of independence in her sons? . . . The mother must possess these high and noble qualities, or she never can impart them to her offspring...\"\\n\\nQuotations about her\\n“We know of no object more deserving of contempt, loathing, and abhorrence than a female atheist. We hold the vilest strumpet from the stews to be by comparison respectable.” —Rev. G. B. Little, 1855\\n\"[H]er [Rose\\'s] right to [speak] is no more to be questioned than yours is to preach to your congregation or mine to speak on temperance. We live in an age and country where free thought and free speech are acknowledged in theory as they should be in practice.\" —Rev. Armory Battles, 1855\\n\"It is not contempt with which we contemplate the spectacle of a woman who has so far forgotten her sex and her nature as to proclaim herself an unbeliever – it is horror! We shrink from her presence, as we would avoid a viper. Female skepticism is social poison\" —C. F.

In 1971, she invented the Del-Em menstrual extraction kit to provide abortion to women before Roe v Wade.\\nThe outcome of the Roe V. Wade case made abortion legal across the nation, however the cost of abortion to be performed in a hospital would be tremendously expensive. Along with the cost, the background process to get an abortion at this time was extremely sensitive. The process for the doctors was a certification that this pregnancy would be hurting the women, or in a more drastic case, rape. The process alone was already upsetting and having to get approval from a doctor simply elongated the process allowing for mixed emotions to formulate. The Supreme Court\\'s ruling on the Roe v. Wade case allowed for there to be offices with certified clinics that were predominately women so that there was no judgment from other\\'s opinions, or in a more serious note, gender bias. Rothman was critically involved in both of these facilities.\\nIn an interview published in 2002, Rothman described her thought process: \"What did women do before there were doctors? Let\\'s stop the humiliation of trying to persuade the powers that be to legalize abortion. Let\\'s just take back the technology, the tools, the skills and the information to perform early abortions and be in charge of our own reproduction.\"\\nShe was born Evelyn Lorraine Fleishman in San Francisco, California in 1932. While working full-time, she attended Los Angeles City College and California State University Los Angeles, where she received a B.A. and teaching credential in 1954. After marrying in 1954, she moved to Baltimore with her husband, Al Rothman, and taught in the Baltimore City Public School System. She returned to California with her husband and children in 1964 and resumed public school teaching.\\nIn 1968, Rothman first joined a local women\\'s liberation group that met at California State University Fullerton, and then became a founding member of the Orange County chapter of NOW. Rothman\\'s collaborative relationship with Carol Downer and the Self-Help Clinic movement began when she attended a meeting in 1971 organized by Downer to discuss women\\'s reproductive rights and abortion. In the weeks before the meeting, Downer and a few other women had visited Harvey Karman\\'s illegal abortion clinic on Santa Monica Boulevard in West Los Angeles to learn how Karman performed abortions. Rothman volunteered to adapt Karman\\'s manual vacuum aspiration equipment for home use. A week after her first meeting with Downer, she demonstrated the prototype of the Del-Em menstrual extraction kit for their group. In 1972, Downer and Rothman founded the first Feminist Women\\'s Health Center (FWHC) in Los Angeles. Later on, she co-founded the second Feminist Women\\'s Health Center (FWHC) in Santa Ana, California. At the FIRST Feminist Women\\'s Health Center (FWHC) in Los Angeles, the main priority was for the importance of women awareness of their bodies and allowing for there to be a sense of security. Cervical and vaginal self-exams were demonstrated at the clinic so that women could perform these at home and not have to worry about going to a doctors office and needing mandatory approval otherwise. On top of cervical and vaginal self-exams, the demonstration of the at home pregnancy tests was introduced. Rothman\\'s main priority was to allow for there to be sense of establishment within the patients as well as letting the patients know that there was 100% integrity within these programs. Along with the tests that were taught at the clinic, there was an outreach for a patient advocacy program. Through this patient advocacy program, patients could receive outpatient suction abortions.\\nMany women during this time were not only fighting for their equality but to have a voice, so these important advances served women greatly which is why Rothman was admired significantly, including the reason there are several memorials honoring her legacy.\\nOver the next two decades, Rothman traveled widely, taking the Self-Help Clinic concept to women\\'s groups both in and outside the United States. In addition to working as an administrator, Rothman wrote health education guides for the FWHCs. In 1999, Rothman co-authored a book with Marcia Wexler called \"Menopause Myths and Facts: What Every Woman Should Know About Hormone Replacement Therapy,\" which was critical of hormone replacement therapy. Of HRT she has said, \"Hormone Replacement Therapy is a misnomer: they are not hormones (they are drugs made synthetically in the laboratory), they are not replacing anything (our bodies continue to make enough hormones during and after menopause), and they are not therapeutic (menopause is not a disease).\"\\nLorraine Rothman died of bladder cancer on September 25, 2007, in Fullerton, California.\\nAccording to the book titled Into Our Own Hands, \"Lorraine Rothman developed a menstrual extraction kit that she called the Del-Em, which allowed women to perform early abortions on themselves without having to go to the hospital  and also gave them unprecedented control over their monthly periods.\" Rothman was mostly concerned about more females learning about their bodies. By providing them with this knowledge, she wanted to make sure women were aware that they can have control of their own bodies. According to the same source, \"Due to the tour her and Downer went on, the uproar of women wanting to see their vagina\\'s was a lot more often than usual; therefore, they would grab mirrors and see for themselves\". In light of Rothman\\'s opening of the \"Los Angeles Feminist Women\\'s Health Center\" women all over the world were intrigued by their bodies and self-worth.\\nAs in other famous articles, authors also coincide with Rothman\\'s life choice and stylistic values of gender when it comes to sex as well. A quote from Anne Koedt states, \"Frigidity has generally been defined by men as the failure of women to have vaginal orgasms\",. Due to the fact that many women are unaware of what is going on in their bodies, they tend to believe that the only way to have an orgasm, is through sex,. The article states that there are many more ways for women to have an orgasm.\\n\\nReferences\\n\"Women\\'s History: Feminist Health Movement\" The Virtual Oral Aural History Archive [1]\\nMenopause Myths and Facts: What Every Woman Should Know About Hormone Replacement Therapy.

In 1949, Ruiz was awarded Spanish patent 190,698 for the \"Mechanical Encyclopedia\" (Spanish: la Enciclopedia Mecánica).\\nRuiz Robles wanted to lighten the weight of the books carried by her students, so she devised a device consisting of a series of text and illustrations on reels, all under a sheet of magnifying glass with a light for reading in the dark, and was to incorporate spoken descriptions of each topic. Her device was never put into production but a prototype is kept in A Coruña National Science and Technology Museum.\\n\\nMechanical Encyclopedia\\nThe following is a translated description of the device:\\n\\'When opened, it consists of two parts. On the left there is a series of automatic alphabets, in any language: slight pressure on a button displays the required letters, making words, sentences, a lesson or a topic, and all manner of writings. In the upper right-hand part of the alphabets is a coil with all manner of line drawings, and on the left there is another coil with ornamental and figure drawings. In the lower part of the alphabets there is a plastic sheet for writing, editing or drawing. On the inside there is a box where subjects can be stored. The subjects are stored in the right-hand part, passing beneath a transparent, unbreakable sheet; these can be enlarged, and the books can be illuminated so that they can still be read if there is otherwise no light. The right-hand and left-hand sides of the section the materials pass through contain two coils in which the books the user wants to read in any language are placed; moving these allows all the topics to pass by, stopping as and when the user wishes, or to be collected. The coils are automatic and can be moved from the box and expanded, so that the whole subject remains visible. The device may be placed either on a table (like an ordinary book) or perpendicular to it, which is handy for the user, since it eliminates a great deal of mental and physical effort. All the components are replaceable. When closed, it is the same size as an ordinary book, and easy to handle.

Sherman demanded to take the boy’s version of the aptitude test. The results reflected Sherman\\'s interest in science and listed dentistry or science as her potential career path.\\n\\nCareer\\nSherman was a 1952 alumnus of Gustavus Adolphus College located in St. Peter, Minnesota.\\nShe was the co-inventor along with Samuel Smith of Scotchgard while an employee of the 3M corporation in 1952. Sherman remained at 3M for several years improving on Scotchgard and developed other uses for the product. Scotchgard would become, arguably, the most famous and widely used stain repellent and soil removal product in North America.\\nAn accidental spill of a fluorochemical rubber on an assistant’s tennis shoe was the beginning to the invention of the product. After exhaustive attempts to remove the spill failed, Sherman moved her intention from removing the spill to using the spill as a protectant from spills. Sherman and Smith received US 3574791  on April 13, 1971, for \"invention of block and graft copolymers containing water-solvatable polar groups and fluoroaliphatic groups.\" Sherman holds 13 patents with Smith in fluorochemical polymers and polymerization processes.\\nDue to the success of the product Sherman was featured on Minnesota Public Radio in a call-in segment on WCCO radio\\'s Boone and Erickson show to discuss Scotchgard in 1969. Sherman was recruited to appeal to the housewives in the radio audience.\\nDuring development of the Scotchgard product in the 1950s, Sherman was required to wait for performance results outside of the textile mill during testing due to a rule at that time that women were not allowed in the mill. At that time in American history, there were very few female chemists; Sherman was a rarity in the corporate environment.

During the Second World War, she invented \"Miss Shilling\\'s orifice\", a small metal disc similar to a metal washer that restricted fuel flow to the carburetor helping prevent engine stall in the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines of the Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire fighters, which could lose power or even completely cut out during certain manoeuvres; a significant disadvantage in active service.\\nShilling raced motorbikes in the 1930s, and, after the war, raced cars.\\n\\nEarly life\\nShilling was born at Waterlooville, Hampshire, the daughter of a butcher. At age 14, she bought herself a motorbike, which she tinkered with; she was already determined to become an engineer. After completing secondary school, she worked for an electrical engineering company for three years, installing wiring and generators. Her employer, Margaret Partridge, encouraged her to study electrical engineering at the University of Manchester; she received a bachelor\\'s degree in 1932 and stayed on for a year to get a Master of Science degree in mechanical engineering. Jobs were hard to find in the Depression; she worked as a research assistant for Professor G. F. Mucklow at the University of Birmingham. In 1936 she was recruited as a scientific officer by the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE), the research and development agency of the Royal Air Force (RAF) in Farnborough, Hampshire. She worked at Royal Aircraft Establishment until her retirement in 1969.\\n\\nSecond World War\\nShilling worked on many projects for RAE during the war.\\n\\nThe orifice\\nDuring the Battle of France and Battle of Britain in 1940, RAF pilots discovered a serious problem in fighter planes with Merlin engines, such as the Hurricane and Spitfire. When the plane went nose-down to begin a dive, the resulting negative g-force would flood the engine\\'s carburettor, causing the engine to stall.\\nGerman fighters used fuel injection engines and did not have this problem. So in action, a German fighter could evade a pursuing RAF fighter by flying a negative g manoeuvre which the RAF plane could not follow.\\nShilling devised the R.A.E. restrictor to solve this problem. It was a brass thimble with a hole in the middle (later further refined to a flat washer), which could be fitted into the engine\\'s carburettor without taking the aircraft out of service. The restrictor limited maximum fuel flow and prevented flooding. By March 1941, she had led a small team on a tour of RAF fighter stations, installing the devices in their Merlin engines. The restrictor was immensely popular with pilots, who affectionately named it \\'Miss Shilling\\'s orifice\\' or simply the \\'Tilly orifice.\\' It continued in use as a stop-gap until the introduction of the pressure carburetor in 1943.\\n\\nLater life\\nAfter the war, Shilling worked on a variety of projects including the Blue Streak missile and the effect of a wet runway upon braking. Shilling was once described by a fellow scientist as \"a flaming pathfinder of Women\\'s Lib\"; she always rejected any suggestion that as a woman she might be inferior to a man in technical and scientific fields. However, her brusque manner and contempt for bureaucracy led to an uneasy relationship with management. Shilling worked for the RAE until 1969, rising to a senior post in the Mechanical Engineering Department.\\nShe held an honorary doctorate from the University of Surrey, and was a CEng and member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and the Women\\'s Engineering Society.\\n\\nMotor sports\\nIn the 1930s, Shilling raced motorbikes. She beat professional riders, such as Noel Pope, and was awarded the Gold Star for lapping the Brooklands circuit at 106 miles per hour (171 km/h) on her Norton M30.\\nAfter the war, Beatrice and husband George turned to racing cars, which were tuned and modified extensively in their home workshop. Starting off their exploits with a much-lightened Lagonda Rapier, between 1959 and 1962 they raced an Austin-Healey Sebring Sprite, most frequently at Goodwood Members\\' Meetings, scoring a number of third places and even one race win. George\\'s driving career became more serious with the 1961 acquisition of an Elva 200 Formula Junior single-seater, but there were accidents for both of them, and the Elva was converted into a Mk VI sports car. In 1967 Beatrice Shilling was brought in to help Dan Gurney solve over-heating problems with his Eagle Mk1 Formula 1 racing car.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nShilling married George Naylor, in September 1938. He also worked at the RAE. According to anecdote, she refused to marry him until he also had been awarded the Brooklands Gold Star for lapping the circuit at over 100 mph. During the Second World War he was a bomber pilot with No. 625 Squadron RAF and reached the rank of Flight Lieutenant. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC). He volunteered for an extra tour of bombing missions, over and above what was expected of him. He suffered tinnitus and other health problems in later life as a result of his wartime activities.\\n\\nLegacy\\nIn 2011, the Wetherspoons chain of public houses opened a pub in Farnborough named the Tilly Shilling in her honour, though the nickname \\'Tilly\\' was never used to her face and was probably an unflattering reference to her appearance being overly utilitarian: the wartime \\'tillies\\' were low-powered pick-ups produced by British car manufacturers for use by the armed forces. In 2015, a collection of her racing badges and trophies was bought by the Brooklands Museum.\\n\\nSee also\\nAnne Burns\\n\\nReferences\\nNotes\\nBibliography\\nExternal links\\nReview of Freudenberg\\'s biography of Shilling'), (1172, 'Amy Smith (born November 4, 1962) is an American inventor, educator, and founder of D-Lab at MIT. She works to develop technologies and build creative capacity internationally.\\n\\nEarly life and education\\nSmith was born in Lexington, Massachusetts. Her father, Arthur Smith, was an electrical engineering professor at MIT. Arthur Smith took his family to India for a year when Amy was growing up while he worked at a university there. \"I think that set a lot of things in motion for her. It\\'s very different from growing up in a Boston suburb\", he said. Smith says that being exposed to severe poverty as a child made her want to do something to help kids around the world. \"Living in India is something that stayed with me—I could put faces on the kids who had so little money.\"\\nSmith received her Bachelor\\'s degree in mechanical engineering from MIT in 1984. Smith returned to MIT after the Peace Corps to get her master\\'s degree in mechanical engineering.\\n\\nPeace Corps service\\nSmith joined the Peace Corps serving four years as a volunteer in Botswana. During her Peace Corps service she was struck by the fact that \"the most needy are often the least empowered to invent solutions to their problems.\" While she was serving in the middle of the Kalahari Desert, she decided what she wanted to do with the rest of her life. \"At one point I had sort of an epiphany, sitting at my desk looking out over the bush, when I realized I wanted to do engineering for developing countries\", Smith said. \"In Botswana, I was teaching and then working for the ministry of agriculture as a beekeeper, and I remember thinking to myself that I really liked doing development work, but I wished could do some engineering too, because I like creative problem solving\", says Smith. \"People in the developing world scrape every last ounce of life that they can out of objects, and my students used to bring me things to fix, and I always enjoyed being able to do that.\"\\n\\nAcademic career\\nShe is a senior lecturer in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at MIT specializing in engineering design and appropriate technology for developing countries. She founded the D-Lab program at MIT which introduces students to technological, social, and economic problems of the Third World. She also co-founded Innovations in International Health to facilitate collaboration among researchers around the world to develop medical technologies for resource-poor settings. She teaches the courses SP.721/11.025: D-Lab: Development and SP.722/2.722: D-Lab Design. She has taught in the past 2.72: Elements of Mechanical Design.\\nSmith encourages women to become engineers although she dislikes being referred to as a woman engineer. \"Actually, because my class involves humanitarian engineering, I very rarely have more men than women. There have been times where there have been ten women and one man. This isn\\'t surprising, given that women often want to see an application to what they\\'re learning that they feel is worthwhile\", says Smith. \"But I\\'m not involved in any particular projects to encourage women engineers, because I dislike being referred to as a woman engineer. I don\\'t like programs that single out woman engineers as particular achievers just for being women. I think that it should be coincidental.\"\\n\\nInventions\\nSmith\\'s designs include the screenless hammer mill and the phase-change incubator, and she is also involved with the application of the Malian peanut sheller in Africa. She is also one of the founders of the popular MIT IDEAS Competition. In 2000 Smith won the Lemelson-MIT Student Prize that honors inventors who are also good role models.\\n\\nMotorized hammermill\\nSmith invented a motorized hammermill that converts grain into flour which she successfully tested in Senegal. The problem with other motor-driven mills is that the screen that filters out rocks and coins could not be made locally and it could take several months to get a new screen. Smith\\'s mill sifted out finished flour aerodynamically using a simpler design that could be manufactured locally by village blacksmiths. \"It\\'s nice when looking at things differently is a good thing, and not something where you get zero credit on a problem\", Smith said. Smith planned to use some of the prize money from the $30,000 Lemelson-MIT Student Prize to produce and distribute the mills.\\n\\nPhase change incubator\\nSmith worked on an incubator that requires no electricity. The device was originally designed to diagnose sexually transmitted diseases. The phase change incubator won the 1999 B.F. Goodrich Collegiate Inventor\\'s Award for $20,000. Smith planned to start a company around the incubator. \"I\\'m not a person who likes money, so whether it makes a profit is neither here nor there\", Smith said. \"I didn\\'t want to be in the position of closing down the product because it wasn\\'t making money. That\\'s not the point of the product.\"\\n\\nCornsheller\\nWith other members of D-Lab and community partners, Smith has developed a small, easy-to-make Cornsheller \"for removing the dried kernels from an ear of corn. The corn sheller can be either casted in aluminum or made from a sheet of metal.\" More information on the Cornsheller including instructions on how to make it are available under a Creative Commons License at the D-Lab Resources page.\\n\\nIDEAS competition\\nSmith co-founded the MIT IDEAS Competition where teams of student engineers design projects to make life easier in the developing world. \"Some of the IDEAS competition winners have been very successful\", says Smith. \"The compound water filter, which removes arsenic and pathogens, is now deployed quite extensively in Nepal. The Kinkajou microfilm projector, used in nighttime literacy classes, is being deployed in Mali. We’re working to commercialize a system for testing water for potability. It\\'s in the field in several countries, but not on a widespread basis. We\\'re looking towards doing a trial of aerosol vaccines in Pakistan, so that\\'s exciting.\"\\n\\nInternational Development Design Summit\\nSmith is one of the lead organizers of the International Development Design Summit (IDDS), held annually to study problems in the developing world and create real, workable solutions to them. \"I believe very strongly that solutions to problems in the developing world are best created in collaboration with the people who will be using them\", Smith said. \"By bringing this group of people together, we get an incredibly broad range of backgrounds and experiences.\\nWorldChanging reported on August 14, 2007 that the results from the first International Development Design Summit had been very positive with end products including an off-grid refrigeration unit tailored for rural areas using an evaporative cooling method to store perishable food and a low-cost greenhouse from recycled and widely available materials.\\nMore information on projects from IDDS can be found here.\\n\\nRethink Relief Design Workshop\\nSmith was instrumental in creating the Rethink Relief Design Workshop in 2011. Rethink Relief is \"dedicated to creating technologies for humanitarian relief that specifically address the gap between short-term relief and long-term sustainable development.\"\\nThe workshop was co-organized in October 2011 by Industrial Design faculty at the Delft University of Technology and D-Lab of MIT. It brought together 26 people to explore the differences in thinking by relief organizations, development organizations, and designers. Groups worked throughout a week to create concepts and prototypes to address challenges in relief work. These addressed clean water availability, re-purposing of aid materials, transportation challenges, and first aid supply logistics.\\nMore information on Rethink Relief, its outputs, and follow-on work can be found here.\\n\\nCreative Capacity Building (CCB)\\nSmith and colleagues at D-Lab have been working on a new type of curriculum - Creative Capacity Building or CCB. The purpose of CCB is to place \"the expertise in the village instead of at MIT.\" \\nThe CCB Curriculum teaches the design process without expecting strong literacy or other academic training. The goal is individuals, groups and communities who are able to not only articulate their needs but to design and build solutions.\\n\\nAwards\\nCollegiate Inventors Award, 1999 (for the phase-change incubator)\\nFirst woman to win the Lemelson-MIT Student Prize, in 2000.\\nMacArthur Fellowship, 2004-2009.\\nTime Magazine named Amy Smith one of their Time 100 Most Influential People for 2010 in the Thinkers category\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nD-Lab Website\\nIDDS Website\\n2010 Time 100, Thinkers: Amy Smith - Time Magazine article\\nAmy Smith - 2000 Student Prize Winner Describes some other inventions (including a technology for diagnosing tuberculosis, and a clamp to regulate intravenous drips), as at February 2000.\\nNecessity Is the Mother of Invention - New York Times article.\\nA MacGyver for the Third World - Wired article\\nDesign that Matters article on an MIT website\\nPeace Corps biography of Amy Smith\\nAmy Smith is one of the lead organizers of first International Development Design Summit\\nMIT Report: Amy Smith in Ghana Full Belly Blog entry, February 2, 2006\\nAmy B.

She was famously widowed in 1889 when Rudolf and his mistress, Mary Vetsera, were found dead in an apparent murder-suicide pact at the Imperial hunting lodge at Mayerling in the Vienna Woods.\\nHer grandfather Leopold I of Belgium was the country\\'s first king. Her aunt, Charlotte of Belgium, the future ill-fated Empress of Mexico, was married to Maximilian, the brother of her future father-in law, the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph.\\n\\nEarly life\\nStéphanie Clotilde Louise Herminie Marie Charlotte was born at the Royal Palace of Laeken in the Kingdom of Belgium. Her mother, Queen Marie Henriette, was an Archduchess of Austria by birth and aunt to the Queen of Spain. Her father, Leopold II of Belgium, finally became king of the Belgians in December 1865. The royal couple were ill-suited for each other and had an unhappy marriage. The contradictory Leopold II was serious and delicate. Marie Henriette was undisciplined, outspoken, and boisterous. Leopold was openly abrasive to her, and tried to dominate her with his criticisms and frequent infidelity. While her natural charm made Marie Henriette more popular with her Belgian subjects than her husband, she eventually retired from court life to escape him, and lived the rest of her life in Spa near the Ardennes.\\nLeopold had little interest in Stéphanie and her older sister Princess Louise, and the education of his daughters was neglected as he focused all his doting attention on his son, Prince Léopold, Duke of Brabant, the future of the Saxe-Coburg and Gotha dynasty in Belgium. Tragically, when he was nine Prince Leopold caught pneumonia and died. His father never recovered. He reconciled briefly with Marie Henriette solely in the hope of producing another male heir, but the result was the birth of Princess Clémentine in 1872. Leopold thereafter lost interest in his family. He turned his attentions to the notorious creation of the Congo Free State, which was his personal fiefdom and not a Belgian colonial territory, and as such its ruthless exploitation amassed him a vast private fortune. Leopold also rejected his family for his mistresses; he had so many scandalous liaisons that he was known to his subjects as Le Roi des Belges et des Belles (“The King of the Belgians and of the Beauties”). In 1909, on his deathbed, he married his favorite mistress in an attempt to expunge the sin of infidelity.\\n\\nCrown Princess of Austria\\nEngagement\\nBrought up in the unhappy life that was the product of their parents\\' arranged marriage, Stéphanie and her sister did no better in their own. Louise was married to her cousin, Prince Philipp of Saxe-Coburg, a harsh man who was fourteen years her senior. After she tried to elope with her lover, Leopold had her committed to a mental asylum. She was finally granted a divorce in 1907.\\nIn March 1880, Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria was invited to the Belgian court at the insistence of Leopold II. Rudolf arrived in Brussels on 5 March. After meeting the fifteen-year-old Princess Stéphanie, he wrote to his mother, Empress Elisabeth, \"I have found what I sought,\" noting that she was \"pretty, good, [and] clever\". Unable under canon law to marry his cousin Archduchess Maria Antonia and having refused several Infantas of Portugal and Spain, he found that Stéphanie was one of the few available Catholic princesses in Europe. Under pressure by his parents to marry as soon as possible, the Crown Prince was satisfied with her and by the 7th of March, he asked for her hand and announced their engagement.\\n\\nWedding\\nStephanie was despatched to Vienna to be taught Imperial court etiquette in preparation for her marriage but a month after her arrival, the ladies-in-waiting realized that the girl had not yet reached puberty. When the obvious questions were put to her, it became clear that she had no idea what was meant; she had been left completely ignorant of the facts of life. The wedding had to be postponed, and the humiliated girl was sent back to Belgium for a time. Rudolf\\'s mother was deeply disappointed with the match as the Belgian monarchy dated only from 1830 and did not compare to the Habsburgs in terms of seniority, though its royal house was a branch of that of Saxony, one of the oldest ruling houses in Europe. Rudolph\\'s father the emperor was pleased, however, and approved the marriage.\\nThe emperor bestowed Walthere Frere-Orban the grand Cross of Saint-Stephen and the Empress bestowed multiple Ladies the honour of the Starry Cross.\\nOn 10 May 1881, several weeks before her 17th birthday, Princess Stéphanie of Belgium married the Crown Prince in the Saint Augustine\\'s Church in Vienna. Her parents walked her down the aisle. Among the illustrious attendees were the future King Edward VII of the United Kingdom and his nephew, the future German Emperor Wilhelm II. In honour of the nuptials, which were celebrated lavishly throughout Austria, the Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa named asteroid 220 Stephania in her honour in 1881, commemorating the union. After the ceremony, the couple honeymooned at Laxenburg outside the capital. On the 18th of May the couple was welcomed in Budapest.\\nThe marriage was happy at first, but difficulties reportedly developed. Though intelligent, Rudolf was highly strung, unconventional, impulsive and very liberal, while Stéphanie\\'s very conservative upbringing left her conventional, formal, and reactionary. Their only child, Archduchess Elisabeth Marie of Austria, was born at Laxenburg Castle on 2 September 1883. She was known within the family as \"Erzsi,\" short for \"Erzsébet,\" the Hungarian form of \"Elisabeth.\" Stephanie received little support from the Imperial family during her marriage. The exceptionally beautiful Empress Elisabeth avoided Stéphanie and disdained her, knowing she was such an inadequate match for her son. The Empress turned out to be right on the matter as the relationship fell apart quickly. Rudolf is said to have infected Stephanie with a venereal disease which made further pregnancies impossible, and they reportedly discussed divorce. Both began to seek consolation outside their marriage. During a visit to Galicia (presently, a region divided between Poland and Ukraine) in 1887, Stéphanie fell in love with a Polish Count. During the next eighteen months, she did not try to hide her affections for the count from her husband, who continued his own liaisons.\\nIn 1889 Rudolf and Baroness Mary Vetsera, his lover, were found dead. Their murder-suicide pact is known as the Mayerling incident.\\n\\nSecond marriage\\nStéphanie married again on the twenty-second of March, 1900, at Miramare. The groom was Count Elemér Lónyay de Nagy-Lónya et Vásáros-Namény (Bodrogolaszi, 24 August 1863 - Budapest, 20 July 1946), a Hungarian nobleman of unequal rank who, in 1917, was elevated by the Emperor of Austria to the rank of Fürst. She settled with her new husband in his castle Oroszvár - Rusovce in western Hungary, modern-day Slovakia, until the advancing Red Army forced them to flee their estate. They found sanctuary in Pannonhalma Archabbey, near Györszentmárton, Hungary.\\nIn 1935 she wanted to publish her memoirs to set the record straight, but this caused a scandal and a court forbade their distribution. These memoirs were eventually published outside of Austria as Ich sollte Kaiserin werden (I Was To Be Empress).\\nStéphanie died at Pannonhalma on 23 August 1945. Her only child, Archduchess Elisabeth Marie of Austria, had four children:\\nPrince Franz Joseph of Windisch-Graetz\\nPrince Ernst of Windisch-Graetz\\nPrince Rudolph of Windisch-Graetz\\nPrincess Stephanie of Windisch-Graetz\\n\\nInvention\\nAs the New York Times noted, Stéphanie \"invented a new chafing dish and spirit lamp combined, and [took] out patents in England, France, Germany, Italy, and Belgium.\"  Her 1908 decision to take out a US patent on a chafing dish surprised the New York Times, not because of her lineage but because \"throughout Europe the proficiency of Columbia’s daughters with the chafing dish is traditional….\"\\n\\nTitles and styles\\nHere are the primary titles and styles that Stéphanie enjoyed from birth to death in chronological order:\\n21 May 1864 - 10 May 1881: Her Royal Highness Princess Stéphanie of Belgium\\n10 May 1881 – 30 January 1889: Her Imperial and Royal Highness The Crown Princess of Austria, Hungary and Bohemia\\n30 Januar 1889 – 22 March 1900: Her Imperial and Royal Highness The Dowager Crown Princess of Austria, Hungary and Bohemia\\n22 March 1900 – 1917: Her Royal Highness Princess Stéphanie, Countess Elemér Lónyai de Nagy-Lónya\\n1917 – 23 August 1945: Her Royal Highness Princess Elemér Lónyai de Nagy-Lónya\\nAdditionally, Stéphanie was born with the titles of Princess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Duchess of Saxony.

She is a member of the National Women's Hall of Fame and the National Inventors Hall of Fame. Her pioneering innovations in water storage and flood control enabled the construction of the Hoover dam and the All-American Canal.\\n\\nChildhood and family background\\nStrong was born in Buffalo, N.Y., fourth daughter of Henry Pierrepont and Mary Guest (Musier) Russell. Strong was educated by private teachers and at Young Ladies Seminary at Benicia, California.\\n\\nMarriage and family\\nIn 1861, the family moved again to Carson City, Nevada, where she met her future husband, Charles Lyman Strong. She was married in Virginia City, Nevada at the age of nineteen, and was left a widow in 1883 with four daughters when her husband committed suicide after a series of business failures. Her husband's property, consisting of mines and other lands in Southern California, was involved in litigation lasting eight years. She then devoted her attention to the management and development of this estate, which was known as Ranchito del Fuerte in San Gabriel Valley, California. It was largely planted with walnut and orange trees, as well as pampas grass, and yielded profitable returns. In 1897 she drilled a number of artesian wells, and to utilize the water thus obtained purchased 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) of land five miles (8 km) away, installed a pumping plant, and incorporated the property under the name of the Paso de Bartolo Water Company, of which she was president, and her two daughters, respectively, treasurer and secretary, and issued bonds amounting to $110,000 to carry on the enterprise, selling the property four years later at a handsome profit.\\n\\nInventor & Water Conservationist\\nHarriet Strong made a study of water problems, including the control of flood waters and water storage. She advocated source conservation as a flood remedy, proposing a succession of dams in the Grand Canyon of the Colorado river to conserve the water for irrigation purposes and the generation of electricity. On Dec. 6, 1887, she was granted a patent for a dam and reservoir construction. Her invention consists of a series of dams, one behind the other, to be constructed in a valley, canyon or watercourse in such a way that when the water has filled the lower dam it will extend up to a certain height upon the lower face of the second dam, and thus act as a brace and support for the dam above it. She obtained another patent, Nov. 6, 1894, on a new method for impounding debris and storing water. She was awarded two medals for these inventions by the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, IL, in 1893. In 1918 she appeared before the congressional committee on water power and urged the government to store the flood waters of the Colorado river by constructing a series of dams by her method in the Grand Canyon, (which in its full capacity is 150 miles (240 km) long), and thus control floods and increase irrigation water, making available thousands of acres of land and unlimited power for generating electricity.\\n\\nLater years\\nStrong had considerable talent as a musical composer; she published a number of songs and a book of musical sketches, and for many years was vice president of the Los Angeles Symphony Orchestra Association. She was the founder of Ebell of Los Angeles, serving as its president for three consecutive terms. She was also a member of the Friday Morning and Ruskin Art clubs of Los Angeles, and became the first female member of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, and of the executive board of the Inland Waterways Association of San Francisco. She was a delegate to the annual convention of the United States Chamber of Commerce, in Chicago, in 1918, representing both the Whittier and Los Angeles chambers of commerce, being the first woman delegate to attend those conventions. She was a member of the board of directors of the Whittier Chamber of Commerce, and chairman of its flood control committee, and member of its Law and Legislative committee, also a member of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Legislative committee. She was also responsible for preserving the adobe of Pio Pico, who had been a family friend when she first moved to Southern California. She had four daughters: Mary Lyman, wife of Dean Mason, of Los Angeles; Harriet Russell; Nelle de Luce Strong; and Georgina Pierrepont, wife of Hon. Frederick C.

Swanson co-developed the first of the Carmen Sandiego educational games, and founded the company Girl Tech, which creates products aimed at making technology more interesting for girls. She has developed award-winning curricula, electronic toys, and books that encourage girls to explore technology and inventions. Her toy inventions include the Snoop Stopper Keepsake Box, Me-Mail Message Center, Zap N’ Lock Journal, and Swap-It Locket. Her publications include Tech Girl\\'s Internet Adventures, Tech Girl\\'s Activity Book, and Girlzine: A Magazine for the Global Girl.\\n\\nBiography\\nSwanson was raised by her mother in San Diego, California, after her father was killed in the Vietnam War. She graduated from Orange Glen High School in 1975, and while in high school, she worked a part-time job at Sears. Not only was she the youngest, she was also the only female salesperson in the television and sound system department and she received awards for her work in sales. She earned a bachelor\\'s degree in liberal studies in 1981 from San Diego State University, and went on to work as a teacher, a flight attendant and a model. She convinced a computer company to donate laptops, and taught her mainly female fellow flight attendants how to use them during their spare time.\\nShe also continued her studies, eventually earning a total of seven academic degrees including a doctorate in organization and leadership, with a doctoral thesis on gender issues in product design, play patterns and gender preferences. Swanson received her Ed.D. in Organization and Leadership Technology in 1997 from the University of San Francisco.\\nIn the late 1980s, Swanson was hired by Brøderbund Software as a product manager, where she helped develop The Treehouse, The Playroom, and the Macintosh edition of the game Where in Time Is Carmen Sandiego?. She invented gadgets for her daughter, including a voice recording device that she hoped to install in Jackie\\'s day care cubby and in her own office. I missed her so much that I used to call my home answering machine to hear her voice, and I thought this would let me talk to her during the day. In 1992 she left Brøderbund to develop a follow-on device that electronically altered a voice\\'s pitch and modulation, which she licensed to Yes! Entertainment (which marketed it as the Yak Bak), and to Tiger Electronics for its Talkboy FX.\\nIn 1995 Swanson decided that she wanted to create toys aimed specifically at girls, and founded Girl Tech as an independent company with headquarters near her home in San Rafael, California. Products included the \"Friend Frame\" talking picture frame, the \"Keepsafe\" storage box with a remote-controlled lock, and a remote listening device called \"Bug \\'Em\". Swanson claimed that her vision for the company did not match the expectations of existing toy distributors: \"For two years after I founded the company, toy store buyers would say, \\'Can you make it pink?\\' \\'Can\\'t you make it for boys?\\' And I would say, \\'No, this is what girls like to play with.\\'\" She later sold the company to Radica Games, now a division of Mattel, for $6 million. She has also licensed her technologies to Hasbro and Sega.\\nSwanson worked as Education Coordinator at the United States Mint, and was a founder at The Art Apprentice. She is now an art teacher in the Del Mar Union School District, and uses computer technology to encourage students\\' creation of art work.

In 1894, Taylor was promoted to Head of the Chemistry Department, and then in 1911 to Head of the Science Department, and she served until 1919. Dorothea Beale, the Principal of Cheltenham Ladies' College in the late 1890s, made an excellent decision to hire Taylor. Principal Beale hoped to improve the science program at the College, especially the chemistry curriculum. Taylor went so far as to design and have built a science wing for the school, that was completed in 1904. This was a significant step forward for British girls' schools science education for these times. Taylor led the way and reigned supreme over her science program from 1894 until 1921.

Taylor was a signatory of the 1904 petition for the admission to the Chemical Society and the 1909 letter to Chemical News, subsequently becoming one of the first group of women to gain admittance to the Chemical Society in 1920. An accomplished researcher, Taylor produced several papers in these fields. On weekends, she would often cycle the eighty-mile round trip from Cheltenham to Bristol.\\nShe received the MSc in 1910 and a D.Sc. in 1911, both awarded by the University of Bristol.\\nDuring World War I Taylor was involved in production of β-eucaine.

Thomas (born February 1943) is an African-American scientist and inventor. She invented the Illusion Transmitter, for which she received a patent in 1980.\\nValerie Thomas was interested in science as a child, after observing her father tinkering with the television and seeing the mechanical parts inside the TV. At the age of eight, she read The Boys First Book on Electronics, which sparked her interest in a career in science. Her father would not help her with the projects in the book, despite his own interest in electronics. At the all-girls school she attended, she was not encouraged to pursue science and math courses, though she did manage to take a physics course. Thomas would go on to attend Morgan State University, where she was one of two women majoring in physics. Thomas excelled in her math and science courses at Morgan State University and went on to work for NASA after graduation.\\n\\nCareer\\nIn 1964, Thomas began working for NASA as a data analyst. She developed real-time computer data systems to support satellite operations control centers (1964–1970) and oversaw the creation of the Landsat program (1970–1981), becoming an international expert in Landsat data products. In 1974 Thomas headed a team of approximately 50 people for the Large Area Crop Inventory Experiment (LACIE), a joint effort with NASA's Johnson Space Center, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. LACIE demonstrated the feasibility of using space technology to automate the process of predicting wheat yield on a worldwide basis. In 1976, she attended an exhibition that included an illusion of a light bulb that was lit, even though it had been removed from its socket. The illusion, which involved another light bulb and concave mirrors, inspired Thomas. Curious about how light and concave mirrors could be used in her work at NASA, she began her research in 1977. This involved creating an experiment in which she observed how the position of a concave mirror would affect the real object that it reflected. Using this technology, she would invent the illusion transmitter. On October 21, 1980, she obtained the patent for the illusion transmitter, a device that NASA continues to use today.\\nIn 1985, she was the NSSDC Computer Facility manager responsible for a major consolidation and reconfiguration of two previously independent computer facilities and infused it with new technology.

Her invention of the Tyng Toy, at the age of 27, illustrated her mastery of form. A construction set for children, the Tyng Toy allowed a small selection of plywood pieces to be combined into a wide variety of toys and pieces of furniture, ranging from a stool to a rocking horse.\\n\\nEducation\\nTyng received her bachelor\\'s degree from Radcliffe College in 1942. Later, she studied with Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer at the architecture school at Harvard University. In 1944, she was among the school\\'s first female graduates. Tyng was the only woman to enter the architecture licensing exam in 1949 and, at the test, one of the male proctors turned his back on her and refused to cooperate.\\nShe obtained her Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania in 1975. Her dissertation was titled, \"Simultaneous Randomness and Order: the Fibonacci-Divine Proportion as a Universal Forming Principle.\" The school\\'s Architectural Archives holds her collected papers.\\n\\nWork\\nTyng was a theorist known for her passion for mathematics and her pioneering work in space frame architecture, in which interlocking geometric patterns are used to create light-filled spaces. She was particularly interested in platonic solids and in Jungian thought. Her Ph.D. thesis, titled Simultaneousness, Randomness and Order, pursued her interests in hierarchical symmetry and organic form. For her work in this field, she became the first woman to receive a grant from the Graham Foundation, in 1965.

Her fascination with complex geometrical shapes had a strong influence on several projects, most notably on the five cubes that comprise the Trenton Bath House and the triangular ceiling of Yale Art Gallery. Tyng also says that the concept for Kahn\\'s famous \"City Tower\" design was largely her invention, though when the model was included in a show at the Museum of Modern Art, Kahn left her name off of the credit label at first. The two also collaborated on the Eserhick Studio and on Bryn Mawr\\'s Erdman Hall.\\nTyng designed the Four-Poster House in Mount Desert Island, Maine. Using logs and cedar shakes, she sought to make the house seem like an outgrowth of its natural environment. The house was also structured around the concept of a four-poster bed, with four central columns, each made from a cluster of four tree trunks, and a top floor entirely given over to a master bedroom. Evidence of her style can also be seen in aspects of her former residence, known as the Tyng house, in Philadelphia\\'s Fitler Square. On its third floor, the building features a pyramidal timber-framed ceiling and slotted windows. Its staircase also utilizes openwork metal screens that she had originally chosen for the Yale Art Gallery project.\\nIn 1989, Tyng published the essay, \"From Muse to Heroine, Toward a Visible Creative Identity,\" which was a study of the development of female creative roles in architecture. In it, she wrote, \"The steps from muse to heroine are accomplished by very few. Most women trained as architects marry architects. No longer the women behind the man, the woman architect in partnership with her husband may nevertheless by barely visible beside (or slightly behind) the hero,\" further noting, \"The greatest hurdle for a woman in architecture today is the psychological development necessary to free her creative potential.\"\\nTyng\\'s influence on Kahn\\'s work was recognized very late in her life.

She wanted to inventory the island\\'s ecosystem. In 1834, a professor, Carmelo Maravigna, wrote in the Giornale Letterario dell’Accademia Gioenia di Catania that Villepreux-Power should be credited with the invention of the aquarium and systematic application of it to the study of marine life. She created three types of aquarium: a glass aquarium for her study, a submersible glass one in a cage, and a cage for larger molluscs that would anchor at sea. Her first book was published in 1839 describing her experiments, called Observations et expériences physiques sur plusieurs animaux marins et terrestres.\\n\\nHer second book, Guida per la Sicilia, was published in 1842. It has been republished by the Historical Society of Messina. She also studied molluscs and their fossils; in particular she favoured Argonauta argo. At the time, there was uncertainty over whether the Argonaut species produced its own shell, or acquired that of a different organism (similar to hermit crabs). Villepreux-Power\\'s work showed that they do indeed produce their own shells.\\nVillepreux-Power was also concerned with conservation, and is credited with developing sustainable aquaculture principles in Sicily.\\nShe was the first woman member of the Catania Accademia Gioenia, and a correspondent member of the London Zoological Society and sixteen other learned societies.\\nVillepreux-Power and her husband left Sicily in 1843, and many of her records and scientific drawings were lost in a shipwreck. Although she continued to write, she conducted no further research. She and husband divided their time between Paris and London. She fled Paris during a siege by the Prussian Army in the winter of 1870, returning to Juilliac. She died in January 1871.\\nIn 1997 her name, \"Villepreux-Power,\" was given to a crater on Venus discovered by the Magellan probe.\\n\\nPopular culture\\nA biographical song about Jeanne Villepreux is featured on \"26 Scientists Volume Two: Newton to Zeno\".

Her system deflected the emissions being produced by factory smokestacks into water tanks, where the pollutants were retained and later flushed \"into the sewer, or into other suitable channels for conducting them to a distant or any desired locality\".\\nMary Walton also invented a system for reducing the noise produced by the elevated railway systems that were rapidly expanding in New York City, where she lived near the Sixth Avenue Line. Her system deadened the noise caused by trains running over the tracks by cradling the tracks in a wooden box lined with cotton and filled with sand. The rights to her invention, patented in 1881, were sold to the Metropolitan Railroad for $10,000 and the system was soon adopted by other elevated railway companies.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nMary Walton Profile on ENGINEERING.com'), (1188, 'Sandra Welner (1958–2001) was an American physician, inventor, and advocate for disabled women\\'s healthcare.\\n\\nEarly life and education\\nSandra Leah Welner was raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the daughter of Nikodem and Barbara Safier Welner. Her parents were both Polish-born and British-educated; her father was a civil engineer, and her mother was a nurse. Sandra graduated from Hillel Academy in 1975, as valedictorian and a National Merit Scholar. Welner enrolled in an accelerated medical education program, where she completed undergraduate work at Lehigh University, and earned her medical degree from the Medical College of Pennsylvania, in 1981 (at age 22). She completed further training in her specialty, obstetrics and gynecology, at Yale University.\\n\\nCareer\\nWelner began her career as a surgeon and an infertility specialist, directing a women\\'s clinic in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1987, she experienced a cardiac arrest while at a hospital in the Netherlands. Complications afterwards led to neurological impairments, particularly affecting mobility, vision, and fine-motor skills. After bleak initial prognosis and five years of rehabilitation, she was eventually able to resume a career in medicine, if not as a surgeon. (She continued to use a cane and other supports.)\\nWelner\\'s practice after her injury focused on primary care for disabled women. Her Washington D.C. location allowed Welner to consult with federal agencies, and with the American Cancer Society and other national organizations. She was also an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Georgetown University and University of Maryland medical schools. She authored several journal articles and contributed to two books about women\\'s health and disability. Her handbook, Welner\\'s Guide to the Care of Women with Disabilities was published posthumously.\\nWelner\\'s work with disabled women patients led her to invent the Welner table, a universally-accessible examination table that adjusts in position and height, for easier transfers from a wheelchair. The table also serves the disabled physician, by allowing a wider range of positions for performing examinations.\\n\\nWorks\\nJournal articles\\nWelner, Sandra; DeCherney, Alan H.; Polan, Mary Lake (January 1988). \"Human menopausal gonadotropins: A justifiable therapy in ovulatory women with long-standing idiopathic infertility\".

She was the second American woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, the first being Gerty Cori.\\n\\nBiography\\nRosalyn Sussman Yalow was born in the Bronx, New York, the daughter of Clara (née Zipper) and Simon Sussman, and was raised in a Jewish household. She went to Walton High School (Bronx), New York City. After high school, she attended the all-female, tuition-free Hunter College, where her mother hoped she would learn to become a teacher. Instead, Yalow decided to study physics.\\n\\nYalow knew how to type, and was able to get a part-time position as a secretary to Dr. Rudolf Schoenheimer, a leading biochemist at Columbia University\\'s College of Physicians and Surgeons. She did not believe that any respectable graduate school would admit and financially support a woman, so she took another job as a secretary to Michael Heidelberger, another biochemist at Columbia, who hired her on the condition that she studied stenography. She graduated from Hunter College in January 1941.\\nA few years later, she received an offer to be a teaching assistant in physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. She received this offer partially because World War II had just begun and many men went off to fight, and the University opted to offer women scholarship to avoid being shut down. At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, she was the only woman among the department\\'s 400 members, and the first since 1917. Yalow earned her Ph.D. in 1945. The next summer, she took two tuition-free physics courses under government auspices at New York University.\\nShe married fellow student Aaron Yalow, the son of a rabbi, in June 1943. They had two children, Benjamin and Elanna Yalow, and kept a kosher home. Yalow did not believe in “balancing her career with her home life” and instead incorporated her home life wherever she could in her work life. Yalow did, however, viewed the traditional roles of a homemaker as a priority, and devoted herself to traditional duties associated with motherhood and being a wife.\\nThroughout her career, she tended to shun feminist organizations, but still, she advocated for including more women in science. While she believed the reason she had certain opportunities in Physics was because of the war, she thought that the reason that the number of women in this field decreased after the war due to a lack of interest. Yalow saw the feminist movement as a challenge to her traditional beliefs and thought that it encouraged women not to fulfill their duties to become mothers and wives.\\n\\nWork\\nThe month after graduating from Hunter College in January 1941, Rosalyn Sussman Yalow was offered a teaching assistantship in the physics department of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Gaining acceptance to the physics graduate program in the College of Engineering at the University of Illinois was one of the many hurdles Yalow had to overcome as a woman in her field. Powerful male figures controlled opportunities for training, recognition, promotion, and many aspects of development in the field of science, and especially physics.\\nWhen Yalow entered the university in September of 1941, she was the only woman in the faculty, which comprised 400 professors and teaching assistants. Yalow was the first woman in more than two decades to attend or teach at this engineering college. Yalow credited her position at the prestigious graduate school to the shortage of male candidates during World War II. Being surrounded by gifted men made Yalow aware of a wider world in science. They recognized her talent, they encouraged her, and they supported her. They were in a position to help her succeed.\\nYalow felt that other women in her field did not like her because of her ambition. Other women saw her curiosity as abandoning the only acceptable path for a women in science at the time, becoming a high school science teacher; but Yalow wanted to be a physicist. During her time at the University of Illinois, Yalow took extra undergraduate courses to increase her knowledge because she wanted to do original experimental research in addition to her regular teaching duties.\\nFor years Yalow faced criticism from women at work but she never quit nor turned her back on other young women, if she believed they had the potential to become real scientists. Yalow never became an advocate for women\\'s organizations in the field of science. She was even quoted saying “It bothers me that there are now organizations for women in science, which means they think they have to be treated differently from the men. I don\\'t approve.” Young girls would write to her after she won the Nobel Prize, but she never responded by organizing or joining an effort to dislodge their barriers. Yalow only served as an example in her field of work and responded exclusively to individuals.\\nYalow’s first job after teaching and taking classes at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana graduate school was as an assistant electrical engineer at Federal Telecommunications Laboratory. She, again, found herself to be the only woman employee. In 1946, she returned to Hunter College to teach physics and consequently influenced many women. She remained a physics lecturer from 1946 to 1950, although by 1947, she began her long association with the Veterans Administration (VA) by becoming a consultant to the Bronx VA Hospital.\\nThe VA wanted to establish research programs to explore medical uses of radioactive substances. By 1950, Yalow had equipped a radioisotope laboratory at the Bronx VA Hospital and decided to leave teaching to finally devote her attention to full-time research. There she collaborated with Solomon Berson to develop radioimmunoassay (RIA), a radioisotope tracing technique that allows the measurement of tiny quantities of various biological substances in human blood as well as a multitude of other aqueous fluids. Originally used to study insulin levels in diabetes mellitus, the technique has since been applied to hundreds of other substances – including hormones, vitamins and enzymes – all too small to detect previously.\\nDespite its huge commercial potential, Yalow and Berson refused to patent the method. In 1968, Yalow was appointed Research Professor in the Department of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital, where she later became the Solomon Berson Distinguished Professor at Large.\\n\\nAwards\\nYalow was awarded a Fulbright fellowship to Portugal, which is an American scholarship program of competitive, merit-based grants that sponsor participants for exchanges in all areas of endeavor, including the sciences, business, academe, public service, government and the arts.\\nIn 1961, Yalow won the Eli Lilly Award of the American Diabetes Association, which provides scholarships for up to 100 scholars to attend Scientific Sessions, the world’s largest scientific and medical conference focused on diabetes and its complications. Additionally, it provides the education and training for these scholars to serve as faculty for professional education programs and to clinically manage the disease.\\nA year later, she was awarded the Gairdner Foundation International Award, which recognizes the world’s most creative and accomplished biomedical scientists who are advancing humanity.\\nThe same year, Yalow was awarded the American College of Physicians Award, which recognizes excellence and distinguished contributions by individuals to internal medicine.\\nIn 1972, Yalow was awarded the William S. Middleton Award for Excellence in Research, which is the highest honor awarded annually by the Biomedical Laboratory Research and Development Service to senior bio biomedical research scientists in recognition of their outstanding scientific contributions and achievements, pertaining to the healthcare of Veterans.\\nAlso in 1972, she was given the Koch Award of the Endocrine Society, which awards individuals for their dedication to excellence in research, education and clinical practice in the field of endocrinology.\\nIn 1975, Yalow and Berson (who had died in 1972) were awarded the American Medical Association Scientific Achievement Award, which is a gold medallion award presented to individuals on special occasions in recognition of their outstanding work in scientific achievement.\\nThe following year she became the first female recipient and first nuclear physicist of the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research. Established by Albert and Mary Lasker in 1945, the award is intended to celebrate scientists who have made fundamental biological discoveries and clinical advances that improve human health.\\nIn 1977, Yalow was the sixth woman, and most importantly first American-born woman, to win the Nobel Prize, together with Roger Guillemin and Andrew V. Schally for her role in devising the radioimmunoassay (RIA) technique. By measuring substances in the human body, the screening of the blood of donors for such diseases as hepatitis was made possible.[17] Radioimmunoassay (RIA) can be used to measure a multitude of substances found in tiny quantities in fluids within and outside of organisms (such as viruses, drugs and hormones). The list of current possible uses is endless, but specifically, RIA allows blood-donations to be screened for various types of hepatitis. The technique can also be used to identify hormone-related health problems. Further, RIA can be used to detect in the blood many foreign substances including some cancers. Finally, the technique can be used to measure the effectiveness of dose levels of antibiotics and drugs.\\nIn 1978, Yalow was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, which provides an opportunity for an early-career professional with training in science or engineering to learn about a career in public policy and administration.\\nIn 1986, Yalow was awarded the A. Cressy Morrison Award in Natural Sciences of the N.Y. Academy of Sciences, which is offered by Mr. Abraham Cressy Morrison to individuals with superlative papers on a scientific subject within the field of The New York Academy of Sciences and its Affiliated Societies.\\nA decade later, Yalow received the National Medal of Science, which is given to American individuals who deserve the highest honor in science and technology.\\n\\nSee also\\nList of female Nobel laureates\\nList of Jewish Nobel laureates\\n\\nReferences\\nFurther reading\\nGoldsmith, S J (1987), \"Georg de Hevesy Nuclear Medicine Pioneer Award Citation--1986.

She made her film debut in 1978 by starring as Laurie Strode in John Carpenter\\'s Halloween (1978). A big hit, the film established her as a notable actress in horror, and she subsequently starred in Halloween II (1981), The Fog (1980), Prom Night (1980), Terror Train (1980), and Roadgames (1981), gaining the status of \"scream queen\" to mainstream audiences. Curtis has since compiled a body of work that spans many film genres, including the cult comedy films Trading Places (1983), for which she won a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, A Fish Called Wanda (1988), and True Lies (1994), for which she won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.\\nCurtis\\'s other notable films include Blue Steel (1989) and Freaky Friday (2003), earning a third Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress for the latter. For her role in the television series Anything But Love (1989–1992), she won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy. Curtis received her first Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress – Miniseries or a Movie for her performance in the television film Nicholas\\' Gift (1998). She also starred in the comedy horror series Scream Queens (2015–2016), for which she received her sixth Golden Globe nomination. Curtis is set reprise her iconic role of Laurie Strode in the horror sequel film Halloween (2018).\\nCurtis is the daughter of the actress Janet Leigh and actor Tony Curtis. She is married to actor, screenwriter, and director Christopher Guest. She has written numerous acclaimed children\\'s books, with her 1998 release Today I Feel Silly, and Other Moods That Make My Day making the best-seller list in The New York Times. She has also appeared in advertisements and is a frequent blogger for The Huffington Post.\\n\\nEarly life\\nCurtis was born in Santa Monica, California, to actor Tony Curtis and actress Janet Leigh. Her paternal grandparents were Hungarian Jewish immigrants. Two of her maternal great-grandparents were Danish, while the rest of her mother\\'s ancestry is German and Scots-Irish. Curtis\\'s parents divorced in 1962, after which her mother married Robert Brandt. Curtis has an older sister, Kelly Curtis, who is also an actress, and several half-siblings (all from her father\\'s remarriages), Alexandra, Allegra, Benjamin, and Nicholas Curtis (who died in 1994 of a drug overdose). Curtis attended Westlake School (now Harvard-Westlake School) in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills High School, and graduated from Choate Rosemary Hall. Returning to California in 1976, she attended the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California. She considered majoring in social work, but quit after one semester to pursue an acting career.\\n\\nCareer\\nFilm\\nCurtis\\'s film debut occurred in the 1978 horror film Halloween, in which she played the role of Laurie Strode. The film was a major success and was considered the highest grossing independent film of its time, earning accolades as a classic horror film. Curtis was subsequently cast in several horror films, garnering her the title, \"scream queen\".\\nHer next film was the horror film The Fog, which was helmed by Halloween director John Carpenter. The film opened in February 1980 to mixed reviews but strong box office, starting Curtis as a horror film starlet. Her next film, Prom Night, was a low-budget Canadian slasher film released in July 1980. The film, for which she earned a Genie Award nomination for Best Performance by a Foreign Actress, was similar in style to Halloween, yet received negative reviews which marked it as a disposable entry in the then-popular \"slasher film\" genre. That year, Curtis also starred in Terror Train, which opened in October and was met with negative reviews akin to Prom Night. Both films performed moderately well at the box office.\\n\\nCurtis had a similar function in both films - the main character whose friends are murdered, and is practically the only protagonist to survive. Film critic Roger Ebert, who had given negative reviews to all three of Curtis\\'s 1980 films, said that Curtis \"is to the current horror film glut what Christopher Lee was to the last one-or Boris Karloff was in the 1930s\". Curtis later appeared in Halloween II, Halloween H20: 20 Years Later and Halloween: Resurrection, as well as performing an uncredited voice role in Halloween III: Season of the Witch. She has been confirmed to reprise her role as Laurie Strode in the 2018 sequel Halloween.\\nHer role in 1983\\'s Trading Places helped Curtis shed her horror queen image, and garnered her a BAFTA award as best supporting actress. 1988\\'s A Fish Called Wanda achieved near cult status – while showcasing her as a comedic actress; she was nominated for a BAFTA as best leading actress. She won a Golden Globe for her work in 1994\\'s True Lies. Her film roles also include Disney\\'s Freaky Friday (2003), opposite Lindsay Lohan, filmed at Palisades High School in Pacific Palisades, California, near where Curtis and Guest live with their children. She was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for this film.\\nIn October 2006, Curtis told Access Hollywood that she had closed the book on her acting career to focus on her family. She returned to acting after being cast in June 2007 in Disney\\'s live-action-animated film, Beverly Hills Chihuahua, co-starring opposite Piper Perabo as one of three live-action characters in the film. She also starred in the 2010 comedy film You Again, opposite Kristen Bell and Sigourney Weaver.\\n\\nTelevision\\nCurtis made her television debut in an episode of Columbo, but her first starring TV role was opposite Richard Lewis in the situation comedy Anything But Love, which ran for four seasons from 1989 through 1992. Her performance as Hannah Miller received both a Golden Globe and People\\'s Choice Award. She appeared as nurse Lt. Duran in the short-lived TV series Operation Petticoat (1977), based on the 1959 film which starred her real-life father Tony Curtis.\\nShe starred in the 1981 TV film Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story, playing the role of the eponymous doomed Playmate. She earned a Golden Globe nomination for her work in TNT\\'s adaptation of the Wendy Wasserstein play The Heidi Chronicles. More recently, Curtis starred in the CBS television movie Nicholas\\' Gift, for which she received an Emmy nomination. Curtis also appeared in the science fiction series Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, and an early episode of The Drew Carey Show. Jamie Lee Curtis was a game-show panelist on several episodes of Match Game.\\nIn 2012, she appeared in 5 episodes of the television series NCIS, playing the role of Dr. Samantha Ryan, a potential romantic interest of Special Agent Gibbs (Mark Harmon). It has been hinted that her role may be a recurring one. During an interview, she openly said that if they could develop a story line, she would be more than happy to be on the show more. It was at least the second time Harmon has worked with Curtis; he played her character\\'s fiancé and later husband in the 2003 remake of Freaky Friday.\\n\\nChildren\\'s books\\nWorking with illustrator Laura Cornell, Curtis has written a number of children\\'s books, all published by HarperCollins Children\\'s Books.\\nWhen I Was Little: A Four-Year Old\\'s Memoir of Her Youth, 1993.\\nTell Me Again About The Night I was Born, 1996.\\nToday I Feel Silly, and Other Moods That Make My Day, 1998; listed on the New York Times best-seller list for 10 weeks.\\nWhere Do Balloons Go?: An Uplifting Mystery, 2000.\\nI\\'m Gonna Like Me: Letting Off a Little Self-Esteem, 2002.\\nIt\\'s Hard to Be Five: Learning How to Work My Control Panel, 2004.\\nIs There Really a Human Race?, 2006.\\nBig Words for Little People, ISBN 978-0-06-112759-5, 2008.\\nMy Friend Jay, 2009, edition of one, presented to Jay Leno\\nMy Mommy Hung the Moon: A Love Story, 2010.\\n\\nInvention\\nIn 1987, Curtis filed a US patent application that subsequently issued as Patent No. 4,753,647. This is a modification of a diaper with a moisture proof pocket containing wipes that can be taken out and used with one hand. Curtis refused to allow her invention to be marketed until companies started selling biodegradable diapers, although the full statutory term of this patent expired February 20, 2007, and is now in the public domain.\\n\\nBlogging\\nCurtis is a blogger for The Huffington Post online newspaper. On her website, Curtis tells her young readers that she \"moonlights as an actor, photographer, and closet organizer\".\\n\\nHumanitarian and political causes\\nIn March 2012, Curtis was featured with Martin Sheen and Brad Pitt in a performance of Dustin Lance Black\\'s play \\'8\\'—a staged reenactment of the federal trial that overturned California\\'s Prop 8 ban on same-sex marriage—as Sandy Stier. The production was held at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre and broadcast on YouTube to raise money for the American Foundation for Equal Rights. In June 2016, the Human Rights Campaign released a video in tribute to the victims of the 2016 Orlando gay nightclub shooting; in the video, Curtis and others told the stories of the people killed there.\\nCurtis is a self-described Democrat, and has spoken on behalf of the campaign of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.\\n\\nPhilanthropic efforts\\nCurtis is a staunch supporter of children\\'s hospitals and their advocacy efforts.

Past honorees of this organization include Sir Anthony Hopkins and Dame Angela Lansbury. Curtis is also involved in the work of the Children Affected by AIDS Foundation, serving as the annual host for the organization\\'s \"Dream Halloween\" event in Los Angeles, launched every year in October.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nCurtis married actor Christopher Guest on December 18, 1984, becoming The Lady Haden-Guest when her husband inherited the Barony of Haden-Guest in 1996, upon the death of his father. She originally fell in love when she saw a picture of him from the movie This Is Spinal Tap in Rolling Stone saying to her friend Debra Hill \"Oh, I\\'m going to marry that guy\", actually marrying him five months later. The couple have two adopted children (Annie, b. 1986; Thomas b. 1996).

The New York Times. \\nJamie Lee Curtis interview at the Wayback Machine (archived December 23, 2007)'), (1065, \"Ellen Eglin (1849- after 1890) was an African-American inventor who invented a clothes wringer for washing machines.\\n\\nPersonal\\nEllen Eglin was born in 1849 in Washington D.C. While living in D.C., Eglin made her living as a housekeeper and a government clerk.\\n\\nHer Invention\\nIn 1800s, she invented a special type of clothes-wringer which was a machine that had two rollers in a frame that was connected to a crank. Clothes would be fed in between the two rollers and as the crank was turned the clothes would have the water pressed out of them. A clothes wringer was made from two wooden pins that are on top of each other with a crank attached to allow the pins to roll. This invention came at a time when there were not a lot of ways to wash clothes other than with your hands. Therefore, this was an amazing invention and concept. However, Eglin decided to sell her patent to a “white person interested in manufacturing the product” for $18. In the April 1890 issue of Woman Inventor, Eglin was quoted as saying “You know I am black and if it was known that a Negro woman patented the invention, white ladies would not buy the wringer. I was afraid to be known because of my color in having it introduced into the market that is the only reason.” The buyer went on to reap considerable financial awards.\\n\\nLater Work\\nAfter selling her clothes-wringer she remained hopeful to patent a second device. She was funding this invention by herself and wanted a patent for it so that people could know that “the invention will be known as a black woman’s.” Despite wanting to exhibit the new model at the Women's International Industrial Inventors Congress, she never went on to patent it. In fact, there is no information that she ever created this invention. She went on to work as a clerk in a census office. Eglin was in a rare position as an inventor because she was one of only a few African American women inventors. She set the stage for later inventors such as Madam C.J. Walker, as well as Sarah Boone. Although Eglin invention became very successful, there is still a lack of sources on the events that took place in her life.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal sources\\nPatent of a Clothes Wringer from 1888\\nMagazine showcasing Ellen Eglin\")]\n"
