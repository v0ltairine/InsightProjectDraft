      "         Josephine Cables Aldrich   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia    Jump to navigation  Jump to search     Josephine Cables Aldrich    Josephine Cables Aldrich (June 12, 1843 – August 12, 1917) was an American spiritualist, Theosophist , editor, and publisher from theh U.S. state of Connecticut . Married to the politician, William F. Aldrich , she was the editor of The Occult World and the publisher of Matilda Joslyn Gage 's The Liberal Thinker . [1]     Contents    1  Early years and education  2  Career  3  Personal life  4  References   4.1  Attribution  4.2  Bibliography    5  External links     Early years and education [ edit ]  Josephine Cables was born in Litchfield, Connecticut . Her mother died when she was young, leaving her in the care of two Puritan grandmothers. They believed that a free use of the rod was necessary to save the child's soul from destruction. This severe treatment taught her that the Golden Rule was by far the best maxim for morality and happiness, and no sooner was she in control of a home of her own in Rochester, New York , than she began to teach the same, turning her home into a sort of Mecca for advance thinkers, not only in the US, but pilgrims came from Europe, Asia and Africa to confer with her.  Career [ edit ]  In 1882, in Rochester, she began publishing \"The Occult World\", a paper devoted to advanced thought and reform work. Her editorials focused on liberality, justice and mercy. She was at one time secretary of the Theosophical Society of the U.S., and president of the Rochester Brotherhood. She lived an affluent lifestyle in Aldrich, Alabama , a mining town named for her husband, William Aldrich, whom she married April 16, 1889. [2] He supported his wife in all her work, and she in turn assisted him to carry out a plan of his, whereby persons accused of crime were defended before the court, at the public expense. She served as vice-president of the Woman's National Industrial League, vice-president of the Woman's National Liberal Union, and was one of the founders of the Woman's National University and School of Useful and Ornamental Arts. [3]  Personal life [ edit ]  There were two adopted children in the family: Farrington, who died at age 19, and Josephine, who married Dr. Farley Winfield Harris. [4] Aldrich died in 1917 in Birmingham, Alabama , and is buried at Rock Creek Cemetery , Washington D.C. .

      "         Janelle Asselin   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia    Jump to navigation  Jump to search  Janelle Asselin is an American comic book editor and writer, known for creating the now defunct publishing company Rosy Press. Asselin currently works as a claims adjuster and currently resides in Omaha, Nebraska . [1]     Contents    1  Personal life  2  Early career   2.1  Hire This Woman  2.2  Teen Titan #1 Cover Review  2.3  Rosy Press and Fresh Romance    3  References  4  External links     Personal life [ edit ]  Asselin was born on April 10, 1983 and grew up in Malvern, Iowa , where she attended Malvern Community Junior Senior High School. She later attended Southern New Hampshire University , where she graduated in 2009 with a bachelor's degree in English, and went on to receive a master's degree in Publishing in 2011 from Pace University .  Asselin has suffered from health issues such as depression and fibromyalgia . [2] [3]  Early career [ edit ]  Asselin began working for Newsarama as a pop culture reviewer and eventually [ specify ] moved to Fangoria Graphix , where she performed various tasks such as proofreading and designing layout. [4] After leaving Fangoria Graphix Asselin worked as a line editor and briefly returned to Newsarama before gaining employment with DC Comics in 2008. While at DC Comics Asselin worked on titles such as Batman , Batgirl , and Birds of Prey before leaving to work for Disney Publishing in 2011. [5] Asselin later stated in 2017 that she left DC due to sexual harassment from a fellow employee and the company's response to complaints filed by her and other female employees. [1]  Asselin was laid off from Disney Publishing in 2013, after which point she began investigating the possibility of creating her own publishing company, Rosy Press. [6] While investigating the possibility of starting her own publishing company, Asselin worked as a Senior Editor part-time at ComicsAlliance [7]  Hire This Woman [ edit ]  Janelle Asselin created \"Hire This Woman\" while writing for ComicsAlliance . \"Hire This Woman\" features a female comic artist or writer in order to help promote talented woman in the comic industry. \"Hire This Woman\" includes women that are up and coming newcomers along with more experienced women in the comic industry. [8] Asselin hoped by creating this feature on ComicsAlliance she would be able to help women find more jobs in the comic book industry. [8] Women featured in these articles include Marguerite Sauvage, [9] Janine Frederick, [10] and Aubrey Aiese. [11] Women interviewed by Janelle Asselin were comic book writers, artists, letterers , colorists , cartoonist , and many more careers in the industry. [12]  Teen Titan #1 Cover Review [ edit ]  In 2014 Asselin published an editorial piece on comic book and pop culture website CBR , criticizing the cover artwork of the first issue of DC's The New 52  Teen Titans relaunch , specifically highlighting the artwork for Wonder Girl . [13] Asselin criticized the work for what she saw as an unrealistic portrayal of a teenage female body and that Wonder Girl's was drawn inappropriately and disproportionally. [13] After the piece was published Asselin received multiple threats of rape and other bodily harm as well as derogatory sexual remarks questioning her professionalism and experience in the comic book industry. [14] In response to these threats as well as content that site founder Jonah Weiland described as \"a negativity and nastiness that has existed on the CBR forums for too long\", the site's forums were closed in favor of a new forum that he hoped would be \"inclusive, diverse, accepting and compassionate\". [15] [16]  Rosy Press and Fresh Romance [ edit ]  Asselin launched Rosy Press with the hope that she would be able to revive the genre of romance comics . The company and its flagship anthology series, Fresh Romance , was funded via a successful Kickstarter campaign. Asselin recruited several of her colleagues to work on the series, including Kate Leth , Arielle Jovellanos, and Sarah Winifred Searle. [17] The first volume of Fresh Romance was released in May 2015 as digital content and was followed up with a print release by Oni Press in 2016. [17] Prior to her announcement in 2016 that she was shuttering Rosy Press due to personal health issues and financial reasons, the Fresh Romance anthology series received nominations for a Dwayne McDuffie Diversity Award and a Harvey Award for Best Anthology . [17] [18]  In November 2016 the Fresh Romance series was picked up by Emet Comics , which also purchased Rosy Press.
